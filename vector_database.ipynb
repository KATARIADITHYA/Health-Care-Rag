NIOSH conducts research and provides recommendations for workers to support the safe and responsible deployment of this technology. Overview Additive manufacturing technologies are rapidly expanding in use and accessibility. Large numbers of people use this technology daily. Additive manufacturing technologies pose potential hazards to users. NIOSH is performing research to understand and minimize potential health and safety risk to workers. Definitions Additive manufacturing (also called 3-dimensional or 3D printing) is a set of technologies that assemble objects from smaller pieces of material. Examples of these technologies include fused filament fabrication, vat polymerization, or powder bed fusion. Once just used for prototyping, these techniques are becoming less expensive and are used in production. Additive manufacturing techniques affect the automotive, aerospace, electronics, medical, and consumer markets. Where is it used? Laboratories Factories Hospitals Schools Libraries Homes What are the types of hazards? Additive manufacturing hazards vary widely depending on the technology, materials used, and the environment they are used in. Hazards include: Inhalation of materials used in powdered form may occur. Materials may emit volatile organic compounds (VOC's) during 3D printing. Dermal exposure to powdered and liquid hazardous materials. Risk of fire or explosion from flammable or combustible substances. Mechanical or ergonomic injury from machine support and maintenance, loading and handling of build materials, and handling of products. What is NIOSH doing to help? NIOSH is conducting research on safe additive manufacturing to identify knowledge gaps, to develop robust science necessary to advance understanding in the field, and to best apply these developments in order to protect workers. One pillar of this effort is traditional, laboratory-based research to answer key questions and solve major problems for safe additive manufacturing. Laboratory studies have indicated that: Fused filament fabrication desktop printers emit respiratory irritants Filament material and coloration significantly affect volatile organic compound emission rates Printing with nanomaterial containing filaments lead to emission of nanomaterial containing particulate matter. A second pillar is comprehensive exposure assessments performed by the NIOSH Nanotechnology and Advanced Materials Field Studies Team at ten different additive\",\n",
       " 'printers emit respiratory irritants Filament material and coloration significantly affect volatile organic compound emission rates Printing with nanomaterial containing filaments lead to emission of nanomaterial containing particulate matter. A second pillar is comprehensive exposure assessments performed by the NIOSH Nanotechnology and Advanced Materials Field Studies Team at ten different additive manufacturing sites. Fieldwork allows NIOSH to fill knowledge gaps on real-world technologies, uses, and exposures. NIOSH continues to perform both laboratory and field studies to determine the hazards and potential for worker exposures while using emerging technologies such as additive manufacturing. Please reach out to us if you are interested in finding out more information or having this team visit your facility. NIOSH is developing a series of \"Additive Manufacturing Health Safety\" videos. These videos will provide information on additive manufacturing/3D printing processes and safety and health information. Low Resolution Video This is the first in a series of videos that NIOSH is producing on additive manufacturing. In this video, we provide an overview of additive manufacturing/3D printing processes and safety and health information. Content includes common hazards, control strategies, and current NIOSH resources.

When did CDC abortion surveillance start? CDC began abortion surveillance in 1969 to document the number and characteristics of women obtaining legal induced abortions. Many states and jurisdictions conduct abortion surveillance. This information is voluntarily reported as aggregate data to CDC. CDC’s surveillance system compiles the information from states and jurisdictions on legal induced abortions. How does CDC define abortion? For the purpose of surveillance, legal induced abortion is defined as \"an intervention performed within the limits of state and jurisdiction law by a licensed clinician (for instance, a physician, nurse-midwife, nurse practitioner, physician assistant) intended to terminate a suspected or known intrauterine pregnancy and that does not result in a live birth.\" This definition excludes management of intrauterine fetal death, early pregnancy failure/loss, ectopic pregnancy, or retained products of conception. Most states and jurisdictions that collect abortion data report whether an abortion was performed by medication or surgery. Are states and jurisdictions required to report their abortion data to CDC? No, states and jurisdictions voluntarily report aggregate data to CDC for inclusion in its annual Abortion Surveillance report. CDC\\'s Division of Reproductive Health prepares surveillance reports as data become available. There is no national requirement for data submission or reporting.

There is no national requirement for data submission or reporting. States and jurisdictions needing guidance on abortion surveillance may contact CDC at Contact CDC-INFO . How is the report prepared and formatted? Preparation of the Abortion Surveillance report is based on the data available from the states and jurisdictions that voluntarily provide this information for a given calendar year. After CDC receives the data, staff perform the analyses that produce the tables, the figure, and the narrative describing methods and trends. For more information on compilation of the report, please view the abstract and methods portion of the most recent Abortion Surveillance report. How is the Abortion Surveillance Report used? This report is used for many purposes in the field of public health, including to: Evaluate programs aimed at promoting equitable access to patient-centered quality contraceptive services in the United States, to reduce unintended pregnancies. Assess changes in clinical practice patterns related to abortion over time, such as changes in method and gestational age at the time of abortion. Estimate the number of pregnancies in the United States, using the number of pregnancies ending in abortion, in conjunction with birth data and estimates of pregnancy loss. Are data available for my own analysis? Besides the data available in the annual Abortion Surveillance report, data are also available for abortions distributed by area of residence and area of clinical service. These data are consistent with data reported to CDC for each year's Abortion Surveillance report. No additional data are available for public use.

Child abuse and neglect can have long-term impacts on health, opportunity, and well-being. What are child abuse and neglect? Child abuse and neglect includes all types of abuse and neglect of a child under the age of 18 by a parent, caregiver, or another person in a custodial role (e.g., a religious leader, a coach, or a teacher) that results in harm, the potential for harm, or threat of harm to a child. There are four common types of abuse and neglect: Physical abuse is the intentional use of physical force that can result in physical injury. Examples include hitting, kicking, shaking, or other shows of force against a child. Sexual abuse refers to any completed or attempted sexual acts or sexual contact with a child by a caregiver. Examples include fondling, penetration, and exposing a child to other sexual activities. Read more information about child sexual abuse . Emotional abuse refers to behaviors that harm a child's self-worth or emotional well-being. Examples include name-calling, shaming, rejecting, and withholding love. Neglect is the failure to meet a child's basic physical and emotional needs. These needs include housing, food, clothing, education, access to medical care, and having feelings validated and appropriately responded to. 1 For more information about child abuse and neglect definitions please see Child Maltreatment Surveillance: Uniform Definitions for Public Health and Recommended Data Elements [4.12 MB, 148 Pages, 508] . Quick facts and stats Child abuse and neglect are common. At least one in seven children experienced child abuse or neglect in the past year in the United States. 2 This is likely an underestimate because many cases are unreported.

       " \"year in the United States. 2 This is likely an underestimate because many cases are unreported. In 2021, 1,820 children died of abuse and neglect in the United States. 3 Children living in poverty experience more abuse and neglect. Experiencing poverty can place a lot of stress on families, which may increase the risk for child abuse and neglect. Rates of child abuse and neglect are five times higher for children in families with low socioeconomic status compared to families with a higher socioeconomic status. Child maltreatment is costly. In the United States, the total lifetime economic burden associated with child abuse and neglect was about $592 billion in 2018. 4 This economic burden rivals the cost of other high-profile public health problems, such as heart disease and diabetes. 5 Outcomes Children who are abused or neglected may suffer immediate physical injuries such as cuts, bruises, or broken bones. They may also have emotional and psychological problems, such as anxiety or posttraumatic stress. Over the long term, children who are abused or neglected are also at increased risk for experiencing future violence victimization and perpetration, substance abuse, sexually transmitted infections, delayed brain development, lower educational attainment, and limited employment opportunities. Abuse and neglect may result in toxic stress, which can change brain development and increase the risk for problems like posttraumatic stress disorder and learning, attention, and memory difficulties. 6 Prevention Child abuse and neglect can be prevented. Certain factors may increase or decrease the risk of perpetrating or experiencing child abuse and neglect. Preventing child abuse and neglect requires understanding and addressing the factors that put people at risk for or protect them from violence. 7 Everyone benefits when children have safe, stable, nurturing relationships and environments. We all have role to play. Keep Reading: Preventing Child Abuse and Neglect On This Page What are child abuse and neglect?

More research is needed to uncover the causes for, and solutions to, violence against older adults. What is older person abuse? Older person abuse is an intentional act or failure to act that causes or creates a risk of harm to an older adult. An older adult is someone aged 60 or older. The abuse occurs at the hands of a caregiver or other trusted person. Common types of abuse include: Physical abuse is illness, injury, functional impairment, or death resulting from the intentional use of physical force. Examples include hitting, kicking, or pushing. Sexual abuse is forced or unwanted sexual interaction. Examples include unwanted sexual contact or penetration or non-contact acts such as sexual harassment. Emotional or psychological abuse refers to verbal or nonverbal behaviors that inflict anguish, fear, or distress. Examples include humiliation, threats, or harassment. Neglect is the failure to meet an older adult's basic needs. These needs include food, water, shelter, clothing, hygiene, and essential medical care. Financial abuse is the illegal, unauthorized, or improper use of money, benefits, property, or assets for the benefit of someone other than the older adult. For more information about elder abuse definitions please see Elder Abuse Surveillance: Uniform Definitions and Recommended Core Data Elements . Quick facts and stats The older adult population is growing faster in the U.S. than are younger populations. The data underestimate the problem because the number of nonfatal injuries is limited to older adults who are treated in emergency departments. The information doesn’t include those treated by other providers or those that do not need or do not seek treatment. Additionally, many cases are not reported because the older adult is afraid or unable to tell police, friends, or family about the violence. Abuse, including neglect and exploitation, is experienced by about 1 in 10 older adults who live at home. 1 From 2002 to 2016, more than 643,000 older adults were treated in the emergency department for nonfatal assaults and over 19,000\",\n",
       " 'unable to tell police, friends, or family about the violence. Abuse, including neglect and exploitation, is experienced by about 1 in 10 older adults who live at home. 1 From 2002 to 2016, more than 643,000 older adults were treated in the emergency department for nonfatal assaults and over 19,000 homicides occurred. 2 Compared with women, men had higher rates of both nonfatal assaults and homicides. 2 3 The rate for nonfatal assaults increased more than 75% among men (2002–2016) and more than 35% among women (2007–2016). The estimated homicide rate for men increased 7% from 2010 to 2016. 2 Compared to non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Black or African American persons, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaskan Natives, and Hispanic or Latino persons have higher homicide rates (2002–2016). 2 Overall and firearm-specific older adult homicide rates increased between 2014 and 2017. Of the 6,188 victims, 62% were male. The perpetrator was an intimate partner in 39% of firearm homicides and 12% of non-firearm homicides. Common contexts of firearm homicides were familial or intimate partner problems, robbery or burglary, argument, and illness-related (e.g. the homicide was perpetrated to end the suffering of an ill victim, both victim and perpetrator had an illness, or the perpetrator had a mental illness). 3 The economic cost of violent injuries against older adults is also substantial. A recent CDC study found that assault injuries to older adults in the United States cost almost $33 billion in 2022. This reflects a rise in both homicides and nonfatal assaults treated in emergency departments among older adults. Specifically, the rate of nonfatal assaults increased by 31%, while the rate of homicides rose by 26% between 2015 and 2022. 4 Outcomes Abuse can have several physical and emotional effects on an older adult. Victims are fearful and anxious. They may have problems with trust and be wary of others. 5 Many victims suffer physical injuries. Some are minor, like cuts, scratches, bruises, and welts. Others are more serious and can cause lasting disabilities. These include head injuries, broken bones, constant physical pain, and soreness. Physical injuries can also lead to premature death and make existing health problems worse. 3 5 6 7 8 Prevention Violence against older adults can be prevented. Certain factors may increase or decrease the risk of perpetrating or experiencing abuse. Preventing violence requires understanding and addressing the factors that put people at risk for or protect them violence. We can all help prevent violence against older adults: 9 Listen to older adults to understand their challenges and provide support. Educate yourself and others about how to recognize and report abuse. Learn how the signs of abuse differ from the normal aging process. Check-in on older adults who may have few friends and family members. Encourage or assist persons (caregivers or older adults) who have problems with drugs or alcohol in getting help. It is also possible to provide over-burdened caregivers with support. This can include help from friends, family, or local relief care groups, adult day care programs, or',\n",

See a healthcare provider right away if you have symptoms of an Acanthamoeba infection. Overview Most people will be exposed to Acanthamoeba during their lifetime. The ameba is found in soil and dust as well fresh water and saltwater. It can also be found in swimming pools, hot tubs, drinking water systems, humidifiers, and in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Most people exposed to Acanthamoeba won't get sick. For others, it can cause serious infections of the brain, skin, eyes, and sinuses. Acanthamoeba can infect parts of the body through cuts or skin wounds or from being inhaled into the lungs or nostrils. It can get into the eyes through contact lens use. Types Non-keratitis Acanthamoeba infections Acanthamoeba can cause serious infections of the skin, eyes, sinuses, and brain. While rare, the brain infections are nearly always fatal. Non-keratitis Acanthamoeba infections are rare but serious infections that can affect one or many parts of the body. These infections usually occur in people with weakened immune systems and include: Granulomatous amebic encephalitis (GAE), which affects the brain and is almost always fatal Cutaneous acanthamoebiasis, a skin infection Acanthamoeba rhinosinusitis, an infection of the nasal cavity and sinuses Disseminated infection, which affects multiple parts of the body.

Good hand hygiene and infection prevention practices can help reduce infection risk. Acinetobacter germs can be resistant to antibiotics, making them difficult to treat. What it is Acinetobacter is a group of bacteria (germs) commonly found in the environment, like in soil and water. Infections caused by Acinetobacter rarely occur outside of healthcare settings. Types Germs in the Acinetobacter baumannii family account for most Acinetobacter infections in humans. This type is sometimes referred to as \" Acinetobacter baumannii complex.\" Signs and symptoms Acinetobacter baumannii can cause infections in the blood, urinary tract, lungs (pneumonia) or wounds. In some cases, people can carry the bacteria without being infected, known as colonization. At-risk populations In the United States, patients in healthcare settings are at highest risk, especially those who: Are on breathing machines (ventilators). Have devices such as catheters. Have open wounds from surgery. Are in intensive care units. Have prolonged hospital stays. People who have weakened immune systems, chronic lung disease or diabetes may be more susceptible. How it spreads Contact with contaminated surfaces. Contact with contaminated equipment. Person-to-person contact, often via contaminated hands. Reducing risk Patients and caregivers Keep their hands clean by regularly washing their hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand sanitizer, including before and after caring for wounds or touching a medical device. Remind people (including healthcare providers) to clean their hands before touching the patient or handling medical devices. Allow healthcare staff to clean their room daily when in a healthcare setting. Healthcare providers Healthcare providers should always follow core infection control practices to reduce the risk of spreading these germs to patients. Testing To determine if someone has an Acinetobacter infection, healthcare providers will send a specimen to the laboratory for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. CDC provides data that can be used for setting breakpoints for interpretation of antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Public Health Reference Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (AST) Data Treatment Antibiotics Acinetobacter infections are generally treated with antibiotics.

The provider will select an antibiotic based on the test results and other factors, like potential side effects or interactions with other drugs. Antimicrobial resistance Unfortunately, many Acinetobacter germs are resistant to multiple antibiotics, which makes them difficult to treat. What CDC is doing Providing testing to identify antimicrobial resistance cases, measure resistance and track transmission in a healthcare setting through the Antimicrobial Resistance Laboratory Network . Tracking Acinetobacter infections through the Emerging Infections Program . Data is also available on the AR & Patient Safety Portal .

Soreness in your chest and feeling tired? You could have a chest cold, often called acute bronchitis. A virus usually causes chest colds. Antibiotics will not help you get better if you have a chest cold. If you're healthy without heart or lung problems or a weakened immune system, this information is for you. Overview A chest cold, often called acute bronchitis, occurs when the airways of the lungs swell and produce mucus in the lungs. That's what makes you cough. Swelling of airways in the lungs produce mucus in the lungs and makes you cough. Signs and symptoms The most common symptom of acute bronchitis is coughing with or without mucus. Symptoms of acute bronchitis last less than 3 weeks. Other symptoms can include: Soreness in the chest Feeling tired (fatigue) Mild headache Mild body aches Sore throat Causes A virus usually causes acute bronchitis. Bacteria can sometimes cause acute bronchitis. Prevention You can help prevent acute bronchitis by doing your best to stay healthy and keep others healthy, including: Clean your hands . Get recommended vaccines, such as the flu vaccine . Don't smoke and avoid secondhand smoke. Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing. When to seek medical care Temperature of 100.4 °F or higher. Cough with bloody mucus. Shortness of breath or trouble breathing. Symptoms that last more than 3 weeks. Repeated episodes of bronchitis. This list is not all-inclusive. Please see a healthcare provider for any symptom that is severe or concerning. Talk to a healthcare provider right away\\u200e If your child is under 3 months old with a fever of 100.4 °F (38 °C) or higher. Treatment Acute bronchitis usually gets better on its own—without antibiotics. When antibiotics aren't needed, they won't help you, and their side effects could still cause harm. Side effects can range from mild reactions, like a rash, to more serious health problems. These problems can include severe allergic reactions, antimicrobial-resistant infections and C. diff infection. C. diff causes diarrhea that can lead to severe colon damage and death.

C. diff causes diarrhea that can lead to severe colon damage and death. How to feel better Get plenty of rest. Drink plenty of fluids. Use a clean humidifier or cool mist vaporizer. Use saline nasal spray or drops to relieve a stuffy nose. For young children, use a rubber suction bulb to clear mucus. Breathe in steam from a bowl of hot water or shower. Use throat lozenges or cough drops. Do not give lozenges to children younger than 4 years of age. Use honey to relieve cough for adults and children at least 1 year of age or older. Ask your healthcare provider about over-the-counter medicines that can help you feel better. Always use over-the-counter medicines as directed. Remember, over-the-counter medicines may provide temporary relief of symptoms, but they will not cure your illness. Over-the-counter medicine and children Carefully read and follow instructions on over-the-counter medicine product labels before giving medicines to children. Some over-the-counter medicines are not recommended for children of certain ages. Pain relievers: Children younger than 6 months: only give acetaminophen. Children 6 months or older: it is OK to give acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Never give aspirin to children because it can cause Reye's syndrome. Reye's syndrome is a very serious, but rare illness that can harm the liver and brain. Cough and cold medicines: Children younger than 4 years old: do not use over-the-counter cough and cold medicines in young children unless a healthcare provider specifically tells you to. Cough and cold medicines can result in serious and sometimes life-threatening side effects in young children. Children 4 years or older: discuss with your child's healthcare provider if over-the-counter cough and cold medicines are safe to give to your child. Ask your healthcare provider about the right dosage of over-the-counter medicines for your child's age and size. Also, tell your child's healthcare provider about all prescription and over-the-counter medicines they are taking. Similar diseases Other illnesses like whooping cough (pertussis) or pneumonia can have similar symptoms to acute bronchitis. If you have whooping cough or pneumonia, your healthcare provider will most likely prescribe antibiotics. Resources Virus vs. Bacteria What's Got You Sick?

Adenovirus vaccine can prevent infection with some types of adenovirus. Adenoviruses can cause illness that is usually mild, but can be serious in some cases. People with weakened immune systems, or existing lung or heart disease, are at higher risk of developing severe illness from an adenovirus infection. Adenovirus infection can cause: Common cold or flu-like symptoms Fever Sore throat Acute bronchitis (inflammation of the airways of the lungs, sometimes called a \"chest cold\") Pneumonia (infection of the lungs) Diarrhea Conjunctivitis (pink eye) Infection with adenovirus can also rarely lead to more serious problems, such as severe pneumonia or neurologic disease (conditions that affect the brain and spinal cord), and even death.

Some people who are infected may have to be hospitalized. Adenoviruses are usually spread from an infected person to others through close personal contact such as touching or shaking hands, through the air by coughing and sneezing, or through handling objects that an infected person has touched. Some adenoviruses can spread through an infected person\\'s stool, for example, during diaper changing. Adenovirus can also spread through the water, such as in swimming pools, but this is less common. Certain adenovirus types (including Type 4 and Type 7) have caused severe outbreaks of respiratory illness among military recruits. Adenovirus vaccine Adenovirus vaccine is only available for United States military personnel. There is currently no adenovirus vaccine available to the general public. Adenovirus vaccine contains live adenovirus Type 4 and Type 7. It will prevent most illness caused by these two virus types. The vaccine comes as two tablets, taken orally (by mouth) at the same time. The tablets should be swallowed whole, not chewed or crushed. The vaccine is approved for military personnel 17 through 50 years of age. It is recommended by the Department of Defense for military recruits entering basic training. It may also be recommended for other military personnel at high risk for adenovirus infection. Adenovirus vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Talk with your health care provider Tell your vaccine provider if the person getting the vaccine: Has had an allergic reaction after a previous dose of adenovirus vaccine , or has any severe, life-threatening allergies . Has a weakened immune system . Is younger than 17 or older than 50 years . Is pregnant or nursing , or planning to become pregnant. Is unable to swallow the vaccine tablets whole without chewing them. Is currently experiencing vomiting or diarrhea . In some cases, your health care provider may decide to postpone adenovirus vaccination to a future visit. People with minor illnesses, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. People who are moderately or severely ill should usually wait until they recover before getting adenovirus vaccine. Virus from the vaccine can be shed in the stool for up to 28 days after vaccination. To minimize the risk of spreading vaccine virus to other people during this period, observe proper personal hygiene , such as frequent hand washing, especially following bowel movements. This is especially important if you have close contact with children 7 years of age and younger, with anyone having a weakened immune system, or with pregnant women. Your health care provider can give you more information. Risks of a vaccine reaction Headache, upper respiratory tract infection, stuffy nose, sore throat, abdominal pain, cough, nausea, diarrhea, fever or joint pain can happen after adenovirus',\n",

Risks of a vaccine reaction Headache, upper respiratory tract infection, stuffy nose, sore throat, abdominal pain, cough, nausea, diarrhea, fever or joint pain can happen after adenovirus vaccine. More serious problems including blood in the urine or stool, pneumonia, or inflammation of the stomach or intestines occur rarely after adenovirus vaccination. As with any medicine, there is a very remote chance of a vaccine causing a severe allergic reaction, other serious injury, or death. What if there is a serious problem? An allergic reaction could occur after the vaccinated person leaves the clinic. If you see signs of a severe allergic reaction (hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, or weakness), call 9-1-1 and get the person to the nearest hospital. For other signs that concern you, call your health care provider. Adverse reactions should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your health care provider will usually file this report, or you can do it yourself. Visit the VAERS website or call 1-800-822-7967 .

This \"virus shedding\" usually occurs without any symptoms, and the person can still spread adenovirus to other people. Prevention Follow simple steps to protect yourself and others CDC recommends simple steps you can take to reduce your risk of getting or spreading a range of common respiratory viruses, including adenovirus.

Although US teen births are declining, the US teen birth rate is higher than in many other high-income countries. US teen birth rates vary among different racial, ethnic, geographic, and socioeconomic groups. Overview The US teen birth rate (births per 1,000 females aged 15-19 years) has declined 78% from 1991 to 2021. Teen birth rates declined from 15 births per 1,000 females in 2020 to 14 births per 1,000 females in 2021. This is a record low and a decrease of 7% from 2020. 1 Reasons for the declines are not totally clear. Evidence suggests these declines are due to more teens abstaining from sexual activity, and more sexually active teens using birth control. 2 Although steadily declining, the US teen birth rate is higher than in other high-income countries. 3 Additionally, rates vary among different racial, ethnic, geographic, and socioeconomic groups. 1 4 What the data show Racial and ethnic disparities The 2021 teen birth rates (births per 1,000 females aged 15-19) 1 varied by race and ethnicity: 24 for non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native females. 22 for non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander females. 22 for non-Hispanic Black females. 21 for Hispanic females. 9 for non-Hispanic White females. 2 for non-Hispanic Asian females. Geographic and socioeconomic disparities Geographic differences in teen birth rates persist, both within and across states. 4 Teens in certain settings\",\n",
       " \"22 for non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander females. 22 for non-Hispanic Black females. 21 for Hispanic females. 9 for non-Hispanic White females. 2 for non-Hispanic Asian females. Geographic and socioeconomic disparities Geographic differences in teen birth rates persist, both within and across states. 4 Teens in certain settings are at higher risk of teen pregnancy and birth than other groups. For example, women ever in foster care were more likely to have a teen birth than women who had never been in foster care. 5 Social determinants of health ( Healthy People 2030 )—such as community levels of high unemployment, low education, and low income—have been associated with higher teen birth rates. Interventions that address socioeconomic conditions like these may play a critical role in addressing disparities observed in US teen birth rates. 6 What CDC is doing Quality sexual and reproductive health services, such as birth control and sexually transmitted infection services, are important for supporting adolescent health. However, best practice recommendations for these services are not always followed. CDC supports the Quality and Access for Reproductive Health Equity (QARE, pronounced 'care') for Teens project . This project is led by the National Association of Community Health Centers, along with Cicatelli Associates (CAI). It aims to improve best practices in health center services and increase access to those services.

There are risks in taking any medicine, vitamin or other supplement. An adverse drug event (ADE) is when a medication causes harm to someone. ADEs include allergic reactions, side effects, overmedication and medication errors. They are a serious public health threat. ADEs are a preventable patient safety problem. Why it's important The number of ADEs can increase due to: Development and use of new medicines. Discovery of new uses for older medicines. The aging American population. Increased use of medicines for disease treatment and prevention. Learning about medication safety can reduce the risk of harm for you and your loved ones. More than 1.5 million emergency visits\\u200e\\u200e Each year in the United States, ADEs cause more than one and a half million visits to hospital emergency departments. Tips Practice medication safety at home Adults Keep a list Keep a list of your medicines, vitamins, and other supplements. Make sure your doctor knows about all the medicines, vitamins and other supplements you take. Follow label directions Take medicines as directed on the label or as instructed by a doctor or pharmacist. Take medicine on time Some medicines should be taken with meals or during a certain time of day (e.g., bedtime). Set timers or reminders to help you remember to take your medicines. You might try a reminder app. Turn a light on Turn on a light when taking medicines so you don't misread the label and make a mistake. If you wear eyeglasses, put them on as well. Ask questions If you do not understand label instructions, talk to your pharmacist or doctor before taking the medicine. Get the tests you need Keep up with any blood testing suggested by your doctor. Children Know the dose. Always: Read the label. Follow directions.

       " \"label instructions, talk to your pharmacist or doctor before taking the medicine. Get the tests you need Keep up with any blood testing suggested by your doctor. Children Know the dose. Always: Read the label. Follow directions. Measure your child's dose using the dosing device (oral syringe, dosing cup) that comes with the medicine. Do not give a child more medicine than stated on the package. Check the label Check the active ingredients in prescription and over-the-counter medicines. Make sure that you do not give your child two medicines that have the same active ingredient. If you have questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. Use the right tool If you do not have a dosing device, ask your pharmacist for one. Do not use household spoons to give medicines to children. Get questions answered If you do not understand the instructions, talk to your pharmacist or doctor before giving the medicine. Teach children Teach your children what medicine is and why you or a trusted adult must give it to them. Lock the safety cap Always check that the cap on a medicine bottle is locked. Put medicines away After locking the safety cap, always put medicines back in their safe storage location. Keep medicines in a place young children cannot reach or see.

VAERS accepts and analyzes reports of adverse events (any side effect or health problem after vaccination that is concerning to you, even if you are not sure if the vaccine caused the event). Anyone — patients, family members, healthcare providers and vaccine manufacturers — can submit a report to VAERS. Healthcare providers and vaccine manufacturers are legally required to report certain events after vaccination. A report to VAERS does not mean that a vaccine caused an adverse event. If it looks as though a vaccine might be associated with a health problem, CDC and FDA investigate further and take action if needed. Overview The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System ( VAERS ) is the nation's early warning system that monitors the safety of FDA-approved vaccines and vaccines authorized for use for public health emergencies. The system accepts and analyzes reports of possible adverse events after vaccination and is co-managed by CDC and FDA. The number of reports submitted varies each year. VAERS accepts reports regardless of seriousness or how likely the vaccine may have caused the adverse event. A report to VAERS does not mean the vaccine caused the event. A VAERS report alone does not indicate whether a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event. Only scientists and public health professionals can make this determination after thorough investigation. Most VAERS reports involve mild side effects such as fever, arm soreness or mild irritability. Federal law defines reports of certain adverse events as serious reports. These include reports of the following after vaccination: Permanent disability. Hospitalization. Extension of an existing hospitalization. Life-threatening illness. Congenital (present at birth) deformity/birth defect. Death. VAERS staff attempt to collect additional information from healthcare providers and\",\n",

Hospitalization. Extension of an existing hospitalization. Life-threatening illness. Congenital (present at birth) deformity/birth defect. Death. VAERS staff attempt to collect additional information from healthcare providers and clinicians about adverse events described in serious reports. While serious adverse events can happen after vaccination, they are rarely caused by the vaccine. NEW! Expanded public access to VAERS data On May 8, 2025, CDC and FDA expanded public access to VAERS data in the WONDER database (wonder.cdc.gov) and in VAERS downloadable files (vaers.hhs.gov) to provide a more complete picture of all reported adverse events following vaccination received. This enhancement is part of a broader CDC and FDA effort to improve transparency and access to vaccine safety data, while continuing to protect patient privacy. Prior to May 8, VAERS public data sets only included the first submitted VAERS report (or primary report) for a patient, vaccine and dose combination. VAERS public data sets now include all subsequent reports (or secondary reports) from the same or different reporters, for the same patient, vaccine, and dose combination. Based on this enhancement, in the downloadable data file, it will appear that additional reports have been added, but these are actually the subsequent or secondary reports that have previously not been included in the public data sets. It\\'s important to note these new reports are related to already reported events and do not represent additional reports of adverse events. Report an adverse event to VAERS Anyone can submit a report to VAERS. Learn more about which adverse events to report and how to report them. VAERS: Access and Use What data VAERS collects The type of vaccine received. The date of vaccination. When the adverse event began. Current illnesses and medications. Medical history. Past history of adverse events following vaccination. Demographic information. How data collection works VAERS is a passive surveillance system, meaning it relies on people sending in reports of their experiences after vaccination. Keep Reading: About CDC’s Vaccine Safety Monitoring Program How the data are used CDC and FDA use VAERS reports to: Assess the safety of newly licensed or authorized vaccines. Detect new, unusual or rare adverse events that happen after vaccination. Monitor increases in known side effects, like arm soreness where a shot was given. Identify potential patient risk factors for particular types of health problems related to vaccines. Identify and address possible reporting clusters. Recognize safe-use problems and administration errors. Watch for unexpected or unusual patterns in adverse event reports. Serve as a vaccine safety monitoring system in public health emergencies. Add to and improve scientific literature and understanding of vaccine safety monitoring.

Signals Patterns or an unusually high number of adverse events reported for a vaccine are called \"signals.\" If they detect a signal, scientists may conduct further studies in VSD or CISA to find out if it represents an actual risk. CDC and FDA investigate further and act if needed. Strengths and limitations of VAERS data When evaluating VAERS data, it is important to understand the strengths and limitations. Strengths VAERS accepts reports from anyone. This also allows VAERS to act as an early warning system to detect rare adverse events. VAERS collects information about the vaccine, the person vaccinated, and the adverse event. Scientists obtain follow-up information on serious reports. All data from the initial VAERS report (without identifying patient information) are available to the public. Limitations VAERS is a passive reporting system, meaning that reports about adverse events are not automatically collected. Instead, someone who had or is aware of an adverse event following vaccination must file a report. Anyone can submit VAERS reports. Some reports can lack details or contain errors. After investigation, scientists find that most events reported to VAERS are not associated with vaccination. The number of reports submitted to VAERS can change in response to media attention and public awareness. Such changes in reporting can complicate interpretation of VAERS data. When more people hear about vaccine side effects, they may report any health outcomes they experience after vaccination. This increase in reporting can complicate detecting patterns of adverse events that should be further assessed in a strong, reliable data analysis system. Such increased reporting can also create the misconception that vaccines are dangerous, leading to fear and hesitation about vaccination. It is usually not possible to use VAERS data to calculate how often an adverse event occurs in a population. The number of people receiving a vaccine is usually not available (a notable exception was during the COVID-19 public health emergency when the number of doses of COVID-19 vaccine administered was reliably reported to CDC). VAERS data alone cannot determine if the vaccine caused the reported adverse event . Establishing a causal relationship requires rigorous scientific assessment and consideration of multiple factors beyond just VAERS reports alone. A report to VAERS does not mean the vaccine caused the event VAERS accepts all reports of adverse events following vaccination without judging whether the vaccine caused the adverse event. Some VAERS reports might represent true vaccine reactions or side effects; others might be coincidental adverse events not related to vaccination. This limitation has caused confusion about the publicly available data.

NIOSH studies how to protect workers from harmful effects of aerosols. NIOSH offers guides and tools to keep workers safe from harmful aerosols. Overview An aerosol can be defined as a suspension of particles or droplets in air. Aerosols may include airborne dusts, mists, fumes, or smoke. Suspended particle sizes may range from a few nanometers (nm) to hundreds of micrometers (µm) in diameter. For comparison a human hair may be between 20 to 180 µm in diameter. Particles can be manufactured or naturally occurring. A welder can potentially be exposed to welding fumes. Aerosols in the workplace may pose both health and safety hazards. Aerosols are encountered across multiple industry sectors. Particles can be inhaled, absorbed by the skin, enter the eyes or be ingested. Factors such as particle size, composition, shape, and concentration, can determine whether particles can cause harm to workers. Harmful effects can be either short or long term. Safety hazards may include slips, fires, or explosions. Research NIOSH has carried out extensive aerosol research in exposure assessment, epidemiology, toxicology, risk mitigation, aerosol sampling and method development. This assists our understanding in: How aerosols are formed and transported through the workplace. Which workers may be most impacted and to what extent. The health implications to workers. The safety implications in the workplace. How to sample for and measure aerosols in the workplace. How to reduce or eliminate the health and safety hazards.

You can get the parasite that causes sleeping sickness from the bite of a tsetse fly in sub-Saharan Africa. Sleeping sickness is a serious disease. Diagnosis and treatment can be lifesaving. Overview Sleeping sickness (i.e., human African trypanosomiasis or HAT) is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei . A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. Sleeping sickness spreads through the bite of a tsetse fly ( Glossina species), found only in rural, sub-Saharan Africa . The disease causes death if left untreated. There are two types of sleeping sickness. Each one is named for the region in Africa where it was historically found. Types There are two types of sleeping sickness: West African sleeping sickness Spread by bites from a tsetse fly carrying the parasite T. b. gambiense . Disease is slow to progress (a few months to a year or more after exposure). Found in rural parts of Central and West Africa. The World Health Organization (WHO) publishes the number of West African sleeping sickness cases reported each year to its website. East African sleeping sickness Spread by bites from a tsetse fly carrying the parasite T. b. rhodesiense. Disease progresses in severity very quickly (one to several weeks after exposure). Found in rural parts of Eastern and Southern Africa and less commonly reported than West African sleeping sickness. The World Health Organization (WHO) publishes the number of East African sleeping sickness cases reported each year to its website. Level 1 Travel Notice CDC has issued a Level 1 travel notice, Practice Usual Precautions, for East African Sleeping Sickness in Zambia and Zimbabwe . Signs and symptoms Sleeping sickness occurs in two stages. The first stage typically causes mild, flu-like symptoms.

       " 'Zimbabwe . Signs and symptoms Sleeping sickness occurs in two stages. The first stage typically causes mild, flu-like symptoms. The second stage causes more severe symptoms that affect your brain and central nervous system. Symptoms of each stage take longer to appear in West African sleeping sickness. If you recently traveled to east or west Africa and were bitten by a tsetse fly, you could have sleeping sickness. Some people who have sleeping sickness develop a red sore, called a chancre, within two days to two weeks of an infected tsetse fly bite but chancres are not always present or noticed. Keep Reading: Symptoms of Sleeping Sickness Risk factors Sleeping sickness affects people in rural areas of African countries. Travelers to urban areas in those countries are at low risk. People at higher risk include: Hunters Villagers with infected cattle herds Tourists visiting and others working in game parks Tsetse flies that spread sleeping sickness live only in some African countries. Most flies in these rural areas are not carrying the parasite that causes sleeping sickness. However, the more often you are bitten, the more you are at risk of infection. You cannot contract the disease in the U.S. How it spreads You can get sleeping sickness from the bite of an infective tsetse fly. Occasionally, a pregnant woman may pass the parasite Trypanosoma brucei to her unborn baby. Although rare and not well documented, the parasite may also spread through Sexual contact Blood transfusion Organ transplantation Accidental laboratory exposure Prevention There is no vaccine or drug available to prevent sleeping sickness.

Older workers are a large and growing part of the workforce. An age-friendly workplace benefits all workers, but especially older workers. Overview Aging is a process experienced by all workers. For many older adults, work provides economic security and social interaction, and improves quality of life. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2021 nearly one in four American workers was age 55 or older. Labor force participation rates for older workers are projected to increase through 2030. Participation rates for workers of other age groups are projected to remain relatively level or decline. It is important to support and protect the health and safety of workers, especially those of advanced age. Attributes of productive aging A life-span perspective views aging as an adaptive and dynamic process. Aging impacts your body, your mind, and how you interact with the world around you. Changes that occur as workers age do not take place in a vacuum. In the workplace, the following factors play a role in productive aging: The nature of work and its structure Workplace relationships Work-related events, like career progression and retirement Ageist beliefs that may interfere with support of productive aging Benefits of an aging workforce Aging workers may provide the following benefits to their workplaces: Institutional knowledge Applicable experience Low levels of stress on the job Get along well with their coworkers Cautious on the job Health, safety, and aging Aging affects a variety of health conditions and outcomes, including chronic conditions and the likelihood of workplace injury. Chronic conditions and aging More than 75% of all workers have at least one chronic condition. The two most common health conditions affecting older workers are arthritis and hypertension. Nearly half of workers over age 55 experience at least one of these conditions. Since many older workers experience chronic conditions, they may be absent from work. On the other hand, there may be an increase in \"presenteeism.\" Presenteeism is when workers show up to work sick. Safety and aging Overall, older workers tend to experience fewer workplace injuries than their younger colleagues. This difference may be',\n",
       " 'workers experience chronic conditions, they may be absent from work. On the other hand, there may be an increase in \"presenteeism.\" Presenteeism is when workers show up to work sick. Safety and aging Overall, older workers tend to experience fewer workplace injuries than their younger colleagues. This difference may be due to their experience or because they are more careful and aware of their physical limitations. Older workers often require more time to heal from workplace injuries. It is important for employers to have a well-planned return to work program. Older workers experience a higher rate of workplace fatalities. Employers need to be mindful of how best to adapt the conditions of work to protect workers. They should also explore opportunities for preventative programs that can maintain or build the health of employees through their working life. Recommendations Creating an age-friendly workplace Many age-friendly work practices benefit workers of all ages. Managers can create age-friendly workplaces by: Prioritizing workplace flexibility and matching tasks to abilities. Give workers a say in their schedule and work tasks. Use self-paced work, rest breaks, and less repetitive tasks. Provide reasonable accommodations after illness or injury. Avoid prolonged, sedentary work. Managing hazards like noise, slip/trip hazards, and physical hazards. Providing and designing ergonomic-friendly work environments. Providing health promotion and lifestyle interventions. Investing in training and building worker skills and competencies. Help older employees learn and adapt to new technologies. Providing age-inclusive management training for supervisors. What\\'s being done Comprehensive and integrated strategies Programs to improve productive aging need to be multi-dimensional and well-coordinated. Work Ability and Total Worker Health ® provide useful frameworks for productive aging by emphasizing sustainable strategies. Work Ability is a worker\\'s capacity to continue working in their current job. It considers work demands and available resources. Work demands include work organization, supervision, time pressures, and fatiguing work. Resources include health and abilities, job skills, autonomy, and support from your supervisor/colleagues/family. Strategies to maintain or improve work ability focus on: Working Conditions: including ergonomics and safety) Employee Health: including safety, health, and well-being) Professional Skills: maintaining and developing knowledge and skills Psychosocial Factors:how employees experience and react to Organizational policies and practices How their work is designed Inter-personal relationships at work Carefully plan and implement programs or interventions and target several of the factors above. Total Worker Health (TWH) integrates workplace safety interventions with activities that advance well-being. A TWH approach comprehensively addresses: Safety The control of psychosocial hazards and exposures The organization of work Outcomes and prioritizing workers A productive aging approach targets outcomes that are important to workers and to organizations, understanding that each can influence the other. Worker-centered outcomes Individual physical and mental health Safe work environment Job satisfaction Ability to meet needs outside of work Organization-centered outcomes Lower healthcare costs Reduced injuries and workers\\' compensation costs Low turnover and absenteeism Productivity Worker-centered and organization-centered outcomes can affect each other.

For example, improving worker well-being provides organizational benefits like: Reduced absenteeism Higher productivity Fewer reported workplace injuries Organizations that transfer knowledge between older and younger workers through mentoring and reverse mentoring programs may increase: Skills and collaborations Productivity Engagement Focusing on both worker-centered and organization-centered outcomes can contribute to a sustainable culture of health. Work culture that supports age differences Age-related differences between generations can include: Attitudes toward work and supervision Communication style Training needs Work habits Creating a culture supportive of productive aging involves: Understanding the age composition of your workforce. Discussing generational and age diversity issues. Developing programs and policies that address the needs of all workers. For example, family leave policies that appeal to young and older workers. Encouraging positive interactions between different age groups. For example, mentoring and reverse mentoring programs. This culture should recognize and use the unique skills, knowledge, and perspectives of workers in all age groups.

NIOSH created an agricultural safety and health program to address the risk of injuries and illnesses experienced by agricultural workers and their families. Quick facts and stats Injuries Between 2021-2022, there were 21,020 injuries in agricultural production that required days away from work. There is well-known underreporting of injuries in this industry. 1 Almost one-third (29%) of injuries in agricultural production that required days away from work from 2021-2022 were from falls. 1 In 2014, An estimated 4,000 youth were injured while working on a farm. 2 Deaths In 2022, workers in the agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting industry had one of the highest fatal injury rates (18.6 deaths per 100,000 full-time equivalents), compared to 3.7 deaths per 100,000 FTE for all U.S. industries. 3 Transportation incidents were the leading cause of death for these farmers and farm workers. Other leading causes were violence by other persons or animals and contact with objects and equipment. 3 In 2022, over half (56%) of deaths in the agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting industry occurred to workers 55 years of age and older. 4 Who is at increased risk In 2023, approximately 2.3 million workers were employed in agriculture and related industries in the U.S. 5 The average age of all U.S. farm producers in 2022 was 58.1 years, up 0.6 years from 2017, continuing a long-term trend of aging in the U.S. producer population. 6 An estimated 893,000 youth under 20 years of age lived on farms in 2014, with just over half (51%) also performing work on the farm. An estimated 266,000 youth were hired to work on U.S. farms in 2014 7 . What's being done In 1990, NIOSH developed an agricultural safety and health program to address the high risks of fatal injuries and illnesses experienced by workers and families in agriculture.

Contaminated agricultural water poses risks to both crops and animals, potentially causing foodborne illness in people who consume fruits or vegetables exposed to it. Overview Agricultural water is water that is used to grow fresh produce, such as fruits and vegetables. Agricultural water can be used for irrigation, pesticide and fertilizer applications crop cooling, frost control, harvesting, and processing. Agricultural water is primarily utilized for irrigation purposes. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), irrigation water ranks as the second largest consumer of water, closely following thermoelectric power, and nearly three times the amount used for public water supply. 1 Where it's found Agricultural water is derived from diverse sources. Municipal water systems, both in urban and rural areas, can also be used for agricultural purposes. Typical sources of agricultural water include: Surface water Rivers, streams, and irrigation ditches Open canals Impounded water bodies like ponds, reservoirs, and lakes Ground water Springs Wells Possible health impacts Contaminated agricultural water can pose significant health risks to both consumers and livestock. Potential health effects include: Foodborne illnesses Gastrointestinal infections Chronic health conditions Prevention The quality of agricultural water is important for public health. Proactive measures, such as effective planning and management of agricultural facilities, monitoring of water quality, and educating farmers about responsible irrigation practices, are essential. These preventive measures can help ensure the safety of agricultural water, protect the quality of food crops, and reduce waterborne and foodborne illnesses in the public.

NIOSH created an agricultural safety and health program to address the risk of injuries and illnesses experienced by agricultural workers and their families. Quick facts and stats Injuries Between 2021-2022, there were 21,020 injuries in agricultural production that required days away from work. There is well-known underreporting of injuries in this industry. 1 Almost one-third (29%) of injuries in agricultural production that required days away from work from 2021-2022 were from falls. 1 In 2014, An estimated 4,000 youth were injured while working on a farm. 2 Deaths In 2022, workers in the agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting industry had one of the highest fatal injury rates (18.6 deaths per 100,000 full-time equivalents), compared to 3.7 deaths per 100,000 FTE for all U.S. industries. 3 Transportation incidents were the leading cause of death for these farmers and farm workers. Other leading causes were violence by other persons or animals and contact with objects and equipment. 3 In 2022, over half (56%) of deaths in the agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting industry occurred to workers 55 years of age and older. 4 Who is at increased risk In 2023, approximately 2.3 million workers were employed in agriculture and related industries in the U.S. 5 The average age of all U.S. farm producers in 2022 was 58.1 years, up 0.6 years from 2017, continuing a long-term trend of aging in the U.S. producer population. 6 An estimated 893,000 youth under 20 years of age lived on farms in 2014, with just over half (51%) also performing work on the farm. An estimated 266,000 youth were hired to work on U.S. farms in 2014 7 . What's being done In 1990, NIOSH developed an agricultural safety and health program to address the high risks of fatal injuries and illnesses experienced by workers and families in agriculture. NIOSH supports extramural research and prevention programs at 12 Centers for Agricultural Safety and Health . These programs conduct research on injuries related to agriculture as well as pesticide exposure, respiratory health, musculoskeletal disorders, underserved populations, and mental health.

       " \"prepare for and protect yourself during and after volcanic eruptions. Additional information on ozone & particulate matter Ozone If you have a respiratory condition like asthma or COPD, ozone can make your symptoms worse. Carefully follow your asthma action plan when ozone levels are high. Ozone has been linked to: Coughing and pain when taking a deep breath Lung and throat irritation Wheezing and trouble breathing during exercise or outdoor activities Ozone can affect anyone, but it bothers some people more than others. People most likely to be bothered by ozone include: People with asthma or other lung diseases Older adults People who exercise or work hard outside Babies and children When the Air Quality Index predicts ground-level ozone levels will be high, follow these steps: Spend more time indoors, where ozone levels are usually lower. Choose easier outdoor activities (like walking instead of running) so you don't breathe as hard. Plan outdoor activities at times when ozone levels are lower (usually in the morning and evening). Particle Pollution (Particulate Matter) Particle pollution , also called particulate matter, is made up of particles (tiny pieces) of solids or liquids in the air. These particles include: Dust Dirt Soot Smoke Drops of liquid Some particles are big enough or dark enough to see, like smoke. Others are so small that you can't see them. Breathing in particle pollution can be harmful to your health. Larger particles, called PM10, irritate the eyes, nose, and throat. Dust from roads, farms, dry riverbeds, construction sites, and mines are types of PM10. Smaller particles, called PM2.5, are more dangerous because they can get into the deep parts of your lungs — or even into your blood. Particle pollution can affect anyone, but it bothers some people more than others. People most likely to be bothered by particle pollution include: People with lung diseases like asthma or COPD People with heart disease People with diabetes Older adults Babies and children If you have asthma, particle pollution can make your symptoms worse. Carefully follow your asthma action plan on days when pollution levels are high. Particle pollution has been linked to: Eye irritation Lung and throat irritation Trouble breathing Lung cancer Heart attacks and other forms of heart disease Problems with babies at birth, like low birth weight When the Air Quality Index predicts particulate pollution levels will be high, follow these steps: Spend more time indoors , where particle pollution levels are usually lower. Choose easier outdoor activities (like walking instead of running) so you don't breathe as hard. Avoid busy roads and highways where PM is usually worse because of emissions from cars and trucks.

Learn how to navigate air quality conditions with the Air Quality Index and find other helpful resources available to you. What you can do The Air Quality Index (AQI) Sometimes the air quality outdoors may not be safe for everyone. What can you do? Pay attention to the Air Quality Index (AQI) . The AQI tells you when high levels of air pollution are predicted and how air pollution affects your health. Finding the AQI is easy. It\\'s on the Web, on many local TV weather forecasts, or you can sign up for free e-mail tools or download the AirNow app . Download Air Quality Index scale The AQI is easy to use. If the AQI predicts a \"Code Orange\" (unhealthy for sensitive groups) day don\\'t cancel your plans—use the AQI to help you plan a better time or place for them. The AQI tells you about major air pollutants in the U.S. that are regulated by the US Environmental Protection Agency, including ozone and particle pollution. Ozone and particle pollution may harm the health of hundreds of thousands of Americans each year. Ozone and particle pollution Let\\'s say that the ozone level where you live is predicted to be Code Orange tomorrow. If you\\'re a runner—even if you\\'re healthy—that air quality could hurt you. Using the AQI, you can plan your run for when ozone levels will be lower, shorten your run or walk instead, or run on a treadmill indoors. Particle pollution has been linked to heart attacks and strokes, and even death in people with heart disease. On a day when particle pollution will be at Code Orange, do something less intense. Walk instead of run or do only lighter outdoor work.

There is no known safe amount of alcohol use during pregnancy. There is no safe time during pregnancy to drink alcohol. All types of alcohol can be harmful, including red or white wine, beer, and liquor. Why it's important Alcohol use during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, preterm birth, stillbirth, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Alcohol use during pregnancy can cause a range of lifelong behavioral, intellectual, and physical disabilities known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) . During pregnancy, alcohol can pass from the pregnant woman to the fetus and affect its development. Not all babies will be affected by alcohol during pregnancy. However, it is impossible to know which babies will be affected. There is no safe time for alcohol use during pregnancy. Alcohol can cause problems for the baby throughout pregnancy, including before a woman knows she is pregnant. Alcohol use in the first 3 months of pregnancy can cause the baby to have abnormal facial features.

       " \"stopped drinking now, but I was drinking in the first few weeks before I knew I was pregnant. What should I do now? The most important thing is that you have completely stopped alcohol use after learning of your pregnancy. It is never too late to stop alcohol use during pregnancy. Because brain growth takes place throughout pregnancy, stopping alcohol use will improve the baby's health and well-being. Make sure you get regular prenatal checkups. If you used any amount of alcohol while you were pregnant, talk with your child's healthcare provider as soon as possible and share your concerns. I drank wine during my last pregnancy and my baby turned out fine. Why shouldn't I drink again during this pregnancy? Every pregnancy is different. Alcohol use during pregnancy might affect one baby more than another. You could have one child who is born healthy and another child who is born with problems. There is no known safe amount of alcohol use during your pregnancy or when you are trying to get pregnant. There is also no safe time for alcohol use during pregnancy.

Going in or near water with a harmful algal bloom can make you and your animals sick. Stay out if water looks discolored, has scum, or smells bad. Overview Algae and cyanobacteria (also called blue-green algae) are plant-like organisms that live in water. They can quickly grow out of control, or \"bloom.\" Some of these blooms produce toxins (poisons) that make people and animals sick. What they look like Harmful algal blooms can look like foam, scum, mats, or paint on the surface of the water. They can also grow underneath the water, making some harmful algal blooms hard to see. A bloom can change the color of the water—for example to green, blue, brown, or red. Keep Reading How to Recognize a Harmful Algal Bloom When they\\'re harmful Not all blooms are harmful. Blooms of algae or cyanobacteria can harm people, animals, or the environment if they: Make toxins Become too dense Use up oxygen in the water Release harmful gases Types Many different types of algae can cause harmful algal blooms. However, three types —cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates, and diatoms—cause most blooms that make people and animals sick. Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) are the most common cause of harmful algal blooms in fresh water, such as lakes or rivers. Dinoflagellates or diatoms are the most common causes of harmful algal blooms in salt water, such as oceans or bays. Keep Reading Types of Harmful Algal Blooms Where they\\'re',\n",

AHF is caused by infection with the AHF virus spread by ticks in Saudi Arabia and Egypt. There is no known spread of AHF between people. There is no treatment for AHF. To protect yourself, avoid tick bites and touching infected animals in areas where AHF occurs. Overview Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever (AHF) is caused by a virus usually spread by ticks. Infections are rare but can be fatal. Since AHF was discovered in 1995, several hundred cases have been reported. AHF cases seem to peak in spring and summer. More research is needed. AHF has been found in Saudi Arabia and Egypt Signs and symptoms Early symptoms of AHF resemble the flu. These symptoms include: Fever Loss of appetite General malaise Diarrhea Vomiting Sometimes, more severe symptoms can develop: Brain swelling Confusion Neck stiffness Coma Bleeding Multi-organ failure Low platelet count Low white blood cell count Elevated liver enzymes How long it takes for signs to show Symptoms can start 2-4 days after being exposed to the virus. Risk factors People may be at risk of AHF if they experience any of the following in areas where the virus is found: Tick bites Contact with livestock and domestic animals, like camels, in tick-infested areas Crushing infected ticks with bare or unprotected fingers How it spreads Transmission of AHF is not well understood and needs further study. AHF is spread to people by ticks, the Ornithodoros savigny i and Hyalomma dromedari species, that feed on livestock and domestic animals. People can become infected through a tick bite or when crushing infected ticks. No spread of AHF between people has been documented. Prevention Avoid tick bites and livestock in areas where AHF is found. Use tick repellents on skin and clothes. Check skin for ticks and remove them promptly. Use tick collars for pets and tick-killing pesticides for livestock. Diagnosis Healthcare professionals can diagnose AHF early with PCR testing or virus isolation. They can also conduct serologic testing using ELISA later in the course of the illness.\",\n",

Diagnosis Healthcare professionals can diagnose AHF early with PCR testing or virus isolation. They can also conduct serologic testing using ELISA later in the course of the illness. Treatment and recovery There is no specific treatment for AHF. Supportive care is given to manage symptoms. 1-20% of patients hospitalized for AHF die. Similar diseases AHF, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), and Rift Valley fever (RVF) have similar signs and symptoms and occur in the same areas.

AHF is caused by infection with the AHF virus spread by ticks in Saudi Arabia and Egypt. There is no known spread of AHF between people. There is no treatment for AHF. To protect yourself, avoid tick bites and touching infected animals in areas where AHF occurs. Overview Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever (AHF) is caused by a virus usually spread by ticks. Infections are rare but can be fatal. Since AHF was discovered in 1995, several hundred cases have been reported. AHF cases seem to peak in spring and summer. More research is needed. AHF has been found in Saudi Arabia and Egypt Signs and symptoms Early symptoms of AHF resemble the flu. These symptoms include: Fever Loss of appetite General malaise Diarrhea Vomiting Sometimes, more severe symptoms can develop: Brain swelling Confusion Neck stiffness Coma Bleeding Multi-organ failure Low platelet count Low white blood cell count Elevated liver enzymes How long it takes for signs to show Symptoms can start 2-4 days after being exposed to the virus. Risk factors People may be at risk of AHF if they experience any of the following in areas where the virus is found: Tick bites Contact with livestock and domestic animals, like camels, in tick-infested areas Crushing infected ticks with bare or unprotected fingers How it spreads Transmission of AHF is not well understood and needs further study. AHF is spread to people by ticks, the Ornithodoros savigny i and Hyalomma dromedari species, that feed on livestock and domestic animals. People can become infected through a tick bite or when crushing infected ticks. No spread of AHF between people has been documented. Prevention Avoid tick bites and livestock in areas where AHF is found. Use tick repellents on skin and clothes. Check skin for ticks and remove them promptly. Use tick collars for pets and tick-killing pesticides for livestock. Diagnosis Healthcare professionals can diagnose AHF early with PCR testing or virus isolation. They can also conduct serologic testing using ELISA later in the course of the illness.\",\n",

Diagnosis Healthcare professionals can diagnose AHF early with PCR testing or virus isolation. They can also conduct serologic testing using ELISA later in the course of the illness. Treatment and recovery There is no specific treatment for AHF. Supportive care is given to manage symptoms. 1-20% of patients hospitalized for AHF die. Similar diseases AHF, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), and Rift Valley fever (RVF) have similar signs and symptoms and occur in the same areas.

Alpha-gal is a molecule found in most mammals, such as cows and pigs, but not in people. People with AGS can have an allergic reaction after eating red meat or being exposed to products containing alpha-gal. The best way to protect yourself and your family from AGS is to prevent tick bites. What is alpha-gal syndrome? Alpha-gal syndrome (AGS) is a serious, potentially life-threatening allergy and tickborne disease. Alpha-gal is a molecule (galactose-α-1,3-galactose) that is naturally produced in the bodies of most mammals but not in people. It is also found in the saliva (spit) of some ticks. When a tick bites, it can transfer alpha-gal from its saliva into a person's blood. The body's natural defenses, or immune system, can identify alpha-gal as a threat and trigger an allergic reaction. Symptoms occur after people eat red meat or are exposed to other products made from mammals . Because of this, AGS is also known as red meat allergy or tick bite meat allergy. View Larger Download In the United States, the lone star tick is most often associated with AGS. A few cases of AGS have been reported following bites from blacklegged and western blacklegged ticks. Nearly 450,000 people may be affected More than 110,000 suspected cases of AGS were identified between 2010 and 2022. However, cases of AGS are not nationally notifiable to CDC. The actual number of AGS cases in the United States is not known, but as many as 450,000 people may be affected. More data and research are needed to understand how many people are affected by this condition. Did you know? Most healthcare providers recommend patients with AGS stop eating: Red meat such as beef, pork, lamb, venison, or rabbit Dairy products, if a person is not able to tolerate\",\n",

Most healthcare providers recommend patients with AGS stop eating: Red meat such as beef, pork, lamb, venison, or rabbit Dairy products, if a person is not able to tolerate dairy Some medicines and non-food products Work with your healthcare provider to understand which products contain alpha-gal . Risk factors AGS is caused by tick bites, though more research is needed to understand the role ticks play in causing AGS. In the United States, AGS is primarily associated with the bite of a lone star tick, and less commonly by the bite of a blacklegged tick or a western blacklegged tick . In other countries, other tick species have been linked to AGS. In the United States, not every person bitten by a lone star, blacklegged, or western blacklegged tick will develop AGS. The reason why certain people develop AGS and others do not is not known. Most cases of AGS have been reported in adults, but people of all ages can develop AGS. Most reported cases of AGS in the United States occur in South, East, and Central states. These are the areas where most lone star ticks are found. Hunters: You're at heightened risk Hunters spend more time outdoors, including walking through thick grass and densely wooded areas and being low to the ground. Prevent tick bites before they happen. Prevention The best way to protect yourself and your family from developing AGS is to prevent tick bites . More ways to reduce risk You can also take steps to protect your pets and reduce risk of tick exposure around your home . Diagnosis A healthcare provider diagnoses AGS by: A physical examination A detailed patient history A test for antibodies your body produces in response to alpha-gal Your healthcare provider may also recommend allergy skin testing to identify reactions to allergens like pork and beef. Living with AGS AGS should be managed under the care of an allergist or other healthcare provider. Most healthcare providers recommend patients with AGS stop eating meat from mammals, such as beef, pork, lamb, venison, or rabbit. Some patients need to eliminate other sources of alpha-gal, such as dairy and certain medications. Patients can work with their healthcare provider to determine which sources of alpha-gal should be avoided. AGS symptoms can range from mild to severe, and some may be life-threatening. People with AGS might not react to every product containing alpha-gal, and some people can experience different symptoms or reactions each time they are exposed to alpha-gal, even when it is the same product.

Most people who are infected don't get sick. Symptoms are often mild for those who do get ill and can include diarrhea and stomach pain. Amebiasis is more common in people living in or traveling to tropical areas with poor sanitary conditions. Antibiotics are effective in treating amebiasis. Overview Amebiasis, caused by the parasite Entamoeba histolytica seen in this magnified image, can be effectively treated with antibiotics. Amebiasis is caused by the parasite Entamoeba histolytica , or E. histolytica . Anyone can get amebiasis. It is more common if you live in a tropical area with poor sanitary conditions or travel to one of these areas. If you think you have amebiasis, see your healthcare provider. The disease can be difficult to diagnose. Most people with amebiasis don't get very sick. Everyone with amebiasis should receive medications to treat the infection. Signs and symptoms Only about 10% to 20% of people infected with E. histolytica become ill. Even then, symptoms are often mild. They can include diarrhea, stomach pain, and stomach cramping. Symptoms usually develop within 2 to 4 weeks but can show up later. A severe form of amebiasis called amebic dysentery can cause stomach pain, bloody poop, and fever. Rarely, E. histolytica travels through the blood stream to the liver and forms an abscess (collection of pus). In a small number of instances, the parasite has spread to other parts of the body, including the lungs and brain. Risk factors In the United States, amebiasis is most common in: People who traveled to tropical places with poor sanitary conditions Immigrants from tropical countries with poor sanitary conditions People who live in facilities with poor sanitary conditions People who have anal sex Causes You can get amebiasis if you: Swallow something such as water or food contaminated with E. histolytica Put something in your mouth that has touched the poop of someone infected with E. histolytica Swallow E. histolytica germs picked up from a contaminated surface or your fingers Prevention Washing your hands thoroughly can help prevent you from spreading amebiasis to others.

You can spread amebiasis to others. The risk is low if you get treated with antibiotics and practice good hygiene. This includes thoroughly washing your hands with soap and water after going to the bathroom or changing diapers. You should also wash your hands before handling or preparing food or drinks. If in an area with poor sanitary conditions: Don\\'t eat or drink: Fountain drinks or any drinks with ice cubes Fresh fruit or vegetables you didn\\'t peel yourself Milk, cheese, and dairy products that may not have been pasteurized Food or drinks sold by street vendors It is safe to drink : Bottled water with an unbroken seal Carbonated (bubbly) water from sealed cans or bottles Carbonated drinks like soda from sealed cans or bottles Tap water that has been boiled for at least 1 minute You also can make tap water safe to drink by first filtering it through an \"absolute 1 micron or less\" filter. Then dissolve chlorine, chlorine dioxide, or iodine tablets in the filtered water. Diagnosis Your healthcare provider will ask for a sample of your poop. You may be asked for several samples from different days. This is because E. histolytica is not always found in every sample. Diagnosing amebiasis can be very difficult. Other parasites and cells can look very similar to E. histolytica under a microscope. If you\\'ve been told that you have an E. histolytica infection but you\\'re feeling fine, you might be infected with a different parasite, Entamoeba dispar, or E. dispar. It is about 10 times more common worldwide. E. dispar doesn\\'t make people sick and doesn\\'t need to be treated. Some laboratories, including CDC, have tests that can tell if a person is infected with E. histolytica or E. dispar . Fluid from liver abscesses can also be tested for E. histolytica . Treatment and recovery A healthcare provider can prescribe antibiotics to treat amebiasis. You will take one antibiotic if you\\'re not feeling sick. If you are sick, you\\'ll probably be prescribed a second antibiotic to take after you\\'ve finished the first.

The Naegleria fowleri ameba (also called the \"brain-eating ameba\") lives in warm fresh water and soil around the world. These infections can be treated with medicines, but most people don\\'t survive. Take steps to help protect yourself from N. fowleri infections, such as preventing water from entering their nose. What it is Primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) is a rare brain infection caused by Naegleria fowleri . Only a few people are diagnosed with PAM in the United States each year. N. fowleri is a free-living ameba. An ameba is a single-celled living organism that is too small to be seen without a microscope. Keep Reading About N. fowleri Infections Symptoms In its early stages, symptoms of PAM are typical meningitis symptoms , including headache, fever, and stiff neck. After the start of symptoms, the disease progresses rapidly. When to seek medical care Anyone with symptoms of meningitis should see a healthcare provider right away. This is especially true if you have been swimming in warm fresh water recently. A healthcare provider can determine if you have meningitis, what\\'s causing it, and the best treatment. Complications Death usually occurs within 5 days (range 1 to 18 days) of the start of symptoms. Only a few people in the United States have survived after becoming infected with N. fowleri . Keep Reading Symptoms Exposure risks Sources of infection N. fowleri lives in warm fresh water and soil around the world. Infections often happen when it\\'s been hot for long periods, resulting in higher water temperatures and lower water levels. Risk factors Fresh water exposure Most N. fowleri infections occur when people swim or submerge their heads in warm fresh water like lakes, ponds, or rivers. Tap water exposure PAM may also occur when people use contaminated tap water to rinse their sinuses for religious or health reasons. In very rare instances, people have become infected from recreational water like splash pads and surf parks that didn\\'t have enough chlorine. Geographic location In the United States, most',\n",
       " 'water exposure PAM may also occur when people use contaminated tap water to rinse their sinuses for religious or health reasons. In very rare instances, people have become infected from recreational water like splash pads and surf parks that didn\\'t have enough chlorine. Geographic location In the United States, most infections have been linked to swimming in warm, southern states. However, evidence suggests the range of N. fowleri is expanding northward as the climate warms. Keep Reading Causes and Risk How it spreads N. fowleri infects people by entering the body through the nose, usually while swimming. The ameba travels up the nose to the brain where it destroys the brain tissue and causes swelling of the brain. How it doesn\\'t spread People cannot get infected with N. fowleri from drinking water contaminated with the ameba. People also don\\'t spread the infection to others. Reducing risk To help protect yourself against N. fowleri infection: Hold your nose or wear a nose clip if you\\'re jumping or diving into fresh water. Always keep your head above water in hot springs. Don\\'t dig in shallow water because the ameba is more likely to live there. Use distilled or boiled tap water when rinsing your sinuses or cleansing your nasal passages. Keep Reading Prevention Testing and diagnosis PAM is difficult to diagnose because of the rarity of the infection and the early symptoms (e.g., fever, headache) are similar to other illnesses. There are laboratory tests that can detect N. fowleri in spinal fluid. Keep Reading Diagnosis Treatment and recovery Several drugs are effective against N. fowleri in the laboratory. However, their effectiveness is unclear since almost all infections have been fatal, even when people were treated.

Ammonia is a toxic clear gas or liquid. Signs and symptoms of ammonia exposure depend on how you were exposed. If exposed, get away from the area, get clean, and get help. Background Ammonia occurs naturally and is produced by human activity. Ammonia is made up of nitrogen and hydrogen. It is an important source of nitrogen, which is needed by plants and animals. It is widely used in fertilizers and pharmaceuticals. At room temperature, ammonia is a clear, colorless gas. Ammonia can also be a clear, colorless liquid that dissolves in water. Changing ammonia to a liquid can help with its storage and transportation. Ammonia can be recognized by its strong smell, which is like the smell of rotting fish. Ammonia reacts with strong oxidizers, acids, halogens (including chlorine bleach), and salts of silver, zinc, copper, and other heavy metals. Ammonia is also commonly used in a liquid form mixed with water, such as household ammonia. Signs and symptoms Normal amounts of ammonia in the environment do not cause health effects in humans. Exposure to high levels of ammonia may hurt your skin, eyes, throat, and lungs and cause coughing and burns. Lung damage and death may occur after exposure to very high levels of ammonia. Most people will smell the chemical or feel irritation that tells you that you are exposed to ammonia. Exposure for a long time may affect people's ability to sense the chemical. Effects depend on how the person was exposed, how much they were exposed to, and how long they were exposed for. Some people with asthma or other chronic lung diseases may be more sensitive to breathing ammonia than others. Symptoms of exposure to higher levels of ammonia include the following: Abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting Coughing or coughing up white or pink colored fluid Skin blisters, pain, or redness Burning feeling in the nose, throat, lungs, and eyes Narrowing of the throat and swelling Permanent or temporary blindness Frostbite\",\n",
       " 'Symptoms of exposure to higher levels of ammonia include the following: Abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting Coughing or coughing up white or pink colored fluid Skin blisters, pain, or redness Burning feeling in the nose, throat, lungs, and eyes Narrowing of the throat and swelling Permanent or temporary blindness Frostbite (if exposed to liquified ammonia) Exposure to very high levels of ammonia can lead to death. Exposure Warning!\\u200e Household ammonia can release gas if it is mixed with certain other cleaning products. Do not mix household cleaners! If ammonia is in the air, people can be exposed through skin or eye contact, or breathing in the gas. Ammonia gas is lighter than air, so it will rise. If ammonia is in water, people can be exposed by touching or drinking water that contains ammonia. Ammonia in food Ammonia is unlikely to be eaten or drunk, because it has a very bad smell and taste. Avoid using or eating food that smells, tastes, or looks unusual. Do not eat food that may have touched liquid ammonia if the food is not in a glass or metal container. If the food is in an unbroken sealed glass or metal container, it should not be affected by an ammonia release. Wash the outside of the container before using. Follow any directions by local authorities. What to do if you are exposed Get away Get away from the area where the ammonia was released and breathe fresh air. If the ammonia release was outdoors, go indoors and shelter in place. Make sure windows are closed and ventilation systems are turned off to make sure the ammonia does not come inside. If you cannot go indoors, leave the area where the ammonia was released. If the ammonia release was indoors, get out of the building. If the ammonia release was from household cleaners or chemicals, open windows and doors to let in fresh air. Leave the area until the gas has gone away. If you cannot get away, go to the lowest ground possible because ammonia is lighter than air and will rise. Who to contact in an emergency\\u200e Call the Poison Control Center for further help at 1-800-222-1222. Get clean Get clean by taking off all clothes, jewelry, and accessories and showering. If you cannot take off all layers, take off as many clothes as you can. Take your clothes off If clothes are frozen to your body, do not try to remove until no longer frozen. Instead, begin washing with a lot of lukewarm water. Then remove your clothes. Do not pull clothing over your head. If you must pull clothing over your head, close your eyes and mouth, and hold your breath. This will stop the ammonia from getting in your eyes, nose, or mouth. Put clothes in a plastic bag. Drop clothes to the floor. If you wear contact lenses, take them out and place them with your clothing. Do not put contact lenses back in. Wash your body First wash',\n",

If you wear contact lenses, take them out and place them with your clothing. Do not put contact lenses back in. Wash your body First wash your hair, face, and hands, and then wash the rest of your body. Wash from your head to your feet with a lot of lukewarm water and mild soap (if available) for several minutes. Finish with a plain water rinse. Try not to let the water run into your eyes, nose, or mouth. Do not scrub! If your eyes are burning or you can't see normally, wash your eyes for 10–15 minutes with lukewarm water. Do not use eye drops. Dry your face, then tilt your head back and dry your hair, and then dry down your body. Use anything that will soak up water. Drop used things to the floor. Dress in any available clean clothes to prevent hypothermia (low body temperature). This is especially important if temperatures are cool. Clear the dirty items If emergency response services are available, leave used items on the floor and report where they are to emergency teams. Move as far from the used items as possible. Otherwise, put on waterproof or heavy gloves that won't let liquid go through. Gather all used things from the floor, including your clothes, and put them in a plastic bag. Remove gloves and put them in the plastic bag. Close the plastic bag and place it in a second plastic bag. Close up the second bag also. Do not put the bags in the regular trash! Place the bags in an area where other people are unlikely to disturb them and touch ammonia. Inform local authorities of the location of the bags for pick up. Get help\\u200e Call 911, go to the hospital (if local officials say it is safe to leave), or call the Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222. Check the radio, television, mobile news app, or text message alerts for more information. Treatment No known cure exists for ammonia exposure. Treatment involves removing ammonia from the body as soon as possible and providing supportive medical care. Symptoms can be treated in a hospital setting or by trained emergency personnel. If someone has swallowed ammonia, do not force vomiting. Long-term health effects While most people recover, survivors who breathed in large amounts may suffer long-term lung damage. If ammonia touches your eyes, it may cause ulcerations (sores) and perforations (holes) to form in the eye. This can occur up to weeks or months after exposure and could lead to blindness. Cataracts (cloudiness in the eyes) and glaucoma (disease that damages the eye) have also been reported after ammonia exposure.

Children under 5, adults over 65, and people with weakened immune systems are more likely to get sick from these germs. Wash your hands after handling reptiles and amphibians, their food, or items in their environment. Provide your pet reptile or amphibian with routine veterinary care to keep it healthy and prevent the spread of disease. Overview Millions of households in the United States own at least one reptile (like a turtle, lizard, or snake) or amphibian (like a frog, salamander, or caecilian). Reptiles have dry and scaly skin, whereas amphibians have smooth, slimy skin. Reptiles and amphibians are more likely than other pets to carry germs that make people sick, even when they appear clean and healthy. The most common germ carried by reptiles and amphibians is Salmonella . Reptiles and amphibians often carry Salmonella bacteria in their digestive tracts. Even healthy reptiles and amphibians can carry the bacteria. People can get sick from Salmonella bacteria through contact with reptiles, amphibians, or their environments, including water from their tanks or aquariums. If you decide that a reptile or amphibian is the right pet for you, it's important to learn how to properly care for your pet. Appropriate husbandry and veterinary care can help keep you both safe from illness. Diseases Below is a list of diseases that reptiles and amphibians can spread.

Diseases Below is a list of diseases that reptiles and amphibians can spread. Aeromonas infection Mycobacterium marinum infection Salmonella infection How to stay healthy around reptiles and amphibians Consider another pet if there are young children, older adults, or people with weakened immune systems in the household. Before buying or adopting a pet reptile or amphibian, make sure it is the right type of pet for your family. Some reptiles can live for a very long time. Reptiles and amphibians require special care and are more likely than other pets to carry germs that make people sick, like Salmonella , even when they appear clean and healthy. Not recommended for certain people Because they are more likely to carry certain germs, reptiles and amphibians aren't recommended for households with young children, people with weakened immune systems, or adults 65 and older . Wash your hands Wash your hands with soap and running water: After feeding your pet or handling pet food After handling your pet's poop or equipment (for example, cages, aquariums, rocks, enrichment, tank decorations, tank water) After cleaning your pet's tank or aquarium Before eating and drinking Use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not readily available. Supervise young children when they use hand sanitizer to prevent swallowing alcohol. Safely care for your pet reptile or amphibian Children's safety Children younger than 5 years old should not handle or touch reptiles or amphibians or their environments because they are at a higher risk for serious illness and hospitalization caused by Salmonella infection. Don't cross-contaminate You don't have to touch a reptile or amphibian to get sick from the germs they carry. Reptile food, tank water, equipment, and habitats can be contaminated with Salmonella and other germs. Keep reptiles, amphibians, and their equipment out of the kitchen or anywhere that food is prepared, stored, served, or eaten. Don't allow reptiles or amphibians to roam freely throughout a home or living area. Supervise your pet when outside of its habitat to prevent accidents and contamination. Change clothing after handling your reptile, especially before interacting with an infant or young child. Safely feed your pet reptile or amphibian Feeder rodents for snakes and other reptiles can carry germs like Salmonella. Keep pet food separate Use a designated container for storing and thawing frozen food for your pet. Keep the pet food away from human food. Wash your hands and clean the container immediately after feeding pet reptiles and amphibians. Using feeder rodents Frozen or live rodents used for pet food, also called feeder rodents, can carry germs that can make people sick. This can happen even if the rodent looks healthy and clean.

Certain people shouldn't handle feeder rodents Children under 5 years old, adults 65 and older, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems shouldn't handle feeder rodents because they are at higher risk for diseases rodents can carry. Freezing feeder rodents does not kill germs. Always wash your hands after handling live or frozen rodents or touching anything they came in contact with. Clean and disinfect all surfaces and supplies that come in contact with rodents. Rodents can contaminate surfaces where they are thawed or anything they touch. You can get sick by touching contaminated surfaces; you don't have to touch the rodents to get sick from their germs. Keep rodents and their supplies out of the kitchen or other areas where food is prepared, served, or consumed. Never use the kitchen sink or food preparation areas to thaw frozen rodents or to clean live rodent habitats. Do not thaw frozen rodents in the microwave. Clean rodent supplies outside your home when possible. If you clean rodent supplies indoors, use a laundry sink or bathtub, and thoroughly clean and disinfect the area right after. Use frozen rodents when possible to reduce the risk of injury to your or your pet. Never feed your pets wild rodents. Safely clean your pet reptile or amphibian's habitat Animal supplies such as tanks, feeders, water containers, and other pet equipment or materials should be cleaned outside the home if possible. Never use food preparation areas to clean reptile and amphibian habitats or equipment. If you clean supplies outside, do so away from gardens or other sources of food or drinking water. If cleaning outside the home isn't possible, clean supplies in a laundry sink or bathtub. If you clean supplies in the bathtub, thoroughly clean and disinfect the area before use by others. Pour tank water and other wastewater from reptile and amphibian habitats down the toilet instead of sinks or drains. Keep Reading About Cleaning and Disinfecting Pet Supplies Prevent reptile scratches and bites Not all reptiles and amphibians have teeth, but even those who don't (like most turtles) can still have painful bites. Bites from reptiles and amphibians can be dangerous because they can spread germs and sometimes other toxic substances, depending on the type of animal. Bites and scratches can be serious injuries and sometimes can become infected. How to prevent bites and scratches Don't kiss or hold reptiles or amphibians close to your face, as this might frighten them and increase your chances of being bitten. Make sure the animal sees you before you pick it up. If an animal is surprised, they might bite out of fear. Feed your reptile with tongs. Don't give them food from your hand.

If you only handle your pet to feed them, they might learn to associate a hand with food. What to do if you are bitten or scratched Wash bites and scratches immediately Pet bites and scratches can spread germs, even if the wound does not seem deep or serious. If you are bitten or scratched by a reptile or amphibian, you should wash the wounds with warm soapy water immediately. Seek medical attention, especially if: The animal appears sick or is acting unusual. The wound or injury is serious (uncontrolled bleeding, unable to move, extreme pain, muscle or bone is showing, or the bite is over a joint). The wound or site of injury becomes red, painful, warm, or swollen. (Especially if the person bitten is younger than 5 years old, 65 or older, a pregnant woman, or has a weakened immune system.) It has been more than 5 years since your last tetanus shot. If the animal becomes sick or dies after biting a person, let your veterinarian know within a few days to a week. They can determine whether the animal might have had germs that could spread to people. Venomous reptiles and amphibians Do not keep venomous animals as pets. CDC does not recommend keeping venomous animals as pets or in household settings. Venoms are a defense that some reptiles and amphibians use to protect themselves from any potential dangers or harm in their environment. Some venomous animals, like poison dart frogs and coral snakes, can be identified by their bright colors and markings. However, some venomous animals are harder to identify. Some animals can transmit venoms through bites or through contact with their skin or saliva. You should always consider the unpredictable nature of venomous animals and be aware that treating a bite from a venomous animal is difficult. Venoms are very toxic and can have severe and life-threatening effects. Antivenoms can treat some bites, but these medications can cost hundreds of dollars and might not be available at some hospitals. In addition, antivenom sometimes can cause allergic reactions that can be just as dangerous as the venom itself. If you keep or work with venomous animals, make a list of all the hospitals in your area that stock antivenoms for those types of animals. Include hospital phone numbers and addresses. Put this list somewhere easy to find, like on your refrigerator or near the animal's habitat. What to do if you are bitten by a venomous animal or get venom on your skin Seek medical attention for venomous bites Seek medical attention immediately for a bite from a venemous animal, even if the wound doesn't seem serious.

       " \"medical attention for venomous bites Seek medical attention immediately for a bite from a venemous animal, even if the wound doesn't seem serious. Call your healthcare provider as soon as possible so that they can prepare the appropriate antivenom. Be as clear as possible about the type, colors, and markings of the animal. Correct identification of the animal helps healthcare providers to provide the appropriate treatment. Don't handle or trap the animal, because venom can be dangerous even after the animal has died. Remain as calm and still as possible until you can be treated by a healthcare provider. Apply first aid: Lay or sit down. If possible, position the bite so that it is below the heart. Remove rings and jewelry before swelling begins. Wash the wound with warm water and soap. Cover the wound with a clean, dry bandage. Go to the hospital as soon as possible. Fast treatment will reduce damage caused by venom and improve chances for recovery. Don't drive. Snake bites can cause dizziness and fainting. How to keep pet reptiles and amphibians healthy Keeping pet reptiles and amphibians healthy can help keep you healthy too. Before choosing a pet reptile or amphibian Think about the people in your household. Some people are at higher risk for serious illness from germs reptiles and amphibians can carry, especially children younger than 5 years old, adults 65 and older, and people with weakened immune systems. Do your research Research and learn how to properly care for reptiles and amphibians before buying or adopting. Ask a veterinarian about the proper food, care, environment, and other needs of the specific pet you are interested in adopting. Find an exotic veterinarian in your area Reptiles and amphibians require specialized care. Most veterinarians do not treat reptiles or amphibians. Check local laws Check state, local, and property laws before selecting or purchasing a reptile or amphibian. Some reptiles or amphibians might not be allowed in apartments or rental homes. Do not keep venomous animals as pets or in household settings. Did You Know? The sale of turtles less than 4 inches has been banned in the United States since 1975. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration made this decision because small turtles pose a higher risk of spreading disease, especially to children. Each year, the ban prevents an estimated 100,000 cases of Salmonella infection among children. How to choose a pet reptile or amphibian Remember that some reptiles and amphibians can live for a very long time. Make sure you are prepared for the commitment of caring for the animal during its long lifespan. Choose healthy animals Ask about the animal's diet and if it has been eating (if an animal isn't eating, there may be a health problem). Don't keep wild animals as pets Don't catch wild reptiles or amphibians and keep them as pets. Buy turtles with shells longer than 4 inches Federal law bans the sale of small turtles , although some are illegally sold in souvenir shops\",\n",

Buy turtles with shells longer than 4 inches Federal law bans the sale of small turtles , although some are illegally sold in souvenir shops and at roadside stands. Buy only from a trusted pet store and avoid roadside or temporary vendors. How to house your reptile or amphibian Provide your reptile or amphibian with a safe, warm, and comfortable environment that has the appropriate humidity levels and lighting. Reptiles and amphibians often have very specific requirements for their habitats. Talk with your veterinarian about your pet's needs. Don't allow pet reptiles and amphibians to interact with or eat wild animals. Monitor your pet's health Exotic veterinarians can help keep pet reptiles and amphibians healthy. Learn about proper management of your reptile or amphibian's health, including temperature and humidity requirements. Taking good care of the animal can decrease your pet's stress and the chances of it getting sick. To keep your pet as healthy as possible, visit an exotic veterinarian experienced in reptile and amphibian care (herpetology) for regular check-ups. A veterinarian will not be able to prevent your reptile or amphibian from shedding Salmonella because these bacteria are normally found in healthy reptiles and amphibians. If your pet becomes sick or dies soon after purchase, take it to the veterinarian and inform the pet store or breeder about the pet's illness or death. Consider waiting before purchasing or adopting another pet. Do not use the habitat until it has been properly cleaned and disinfected. These practices will help prevent the spread of disease. What to do if you no longer want your pet reptile or amphibian Don't release unwanted pets Releasing pets isn't good for the animal or the environment. Most reptiles and amphibians released outdoors will die, and some can threaten natural wildlife Find a new home for your pet: Contact a nearby pet store for advice on rehoming your pet. Contact a local pet rescue group to see if they can help rehome your pet. Contact a local aquarium or zoo to see if they would accept your pet.

It is also called rat lungworm. People can get infected by eating raw or undercooked snails or slugs that are infected with this parasite. Most people infected with rat lungworm recover on their own without treatment. More Information For Everyone Health Care Providers Public Health Overview Angiostrongylus cantonensis is a parasitic worm of rats. It is also called the rat lungworm. The adult form of the parasite is found only in rodents. Infected rats pass larvae of the parasite in their feces. Snails and slugs get infected by ingesting the larvae. These larvae mature in snails and slugs but do not become adult worms. The life cycle is completed when rats eat infected snails or slugs and the larvae further mature to become adult worms. Species Angiostrongylus cantonensis, which is also known as the rat lungworm, causes eosinophilic meningitis and is prevalent in Southeast Asia and tropical Pacific islands. The recognized distribution of the parasite has been increasing over time and infections have been identified in other areas, including Africa, the Caribbean, and the United States. Angiostrongylus costaricensis causes eosinophilic gastroenteritis and is found in Latin America and the Caribbean. Symptoms Some infected people don’t have any symptoms—or have only mild symptoms that don’t last very long. Sometimes the infection causes a rare type of meningitis (eosinophilic meningitis). The symptoms can include headache, stiff neck, tingling or painful feelings in the skin, low-grade fever, nausea, and vomiting. How it spreads People can get infected by eating raw or undercooked snails or slugs that are infected with this parasite. In some cultures, snails are commonly eaten.

Some children, in particular, have gotten infected by swallowing snails/slugs \"on a dare. \" People also can get infected by accident, by eating raw produce (such as lettuce) that contains a small snail or slug or part of one. Certain animals such freshwater shrimp, crabs, or frogs, have been found to be infected with larvae of the parasite. African land snails, which can grow larger than a person’s hand, is just one of many types that can be infected. But snails can be infected only if they have ingested contaminated rat feces. It is possible that eating undercooked or raw animals that are infected could result in people becoming infected, though the evidence for this is not as clear as for eating infected snails and slugs. Of note, fish do not spread this parasite. Resource\\u200e This video illustrates how people get infected with A. cantonensis or rat lungworm. Prevention Don’t eat raw or undercooked snails or slugs, frogs or shrimp/prawns. If you handle snails or slugs, wear gloves and wash your hands. Always remember to thoroughly wash fresh produce. When travelling in areas where the parasite is common, avoid eating uncooked vegetables. Testing and diagnosis See your healthcare provider, who will examine you and ask about any symptoms, travel, and exposures you’ve had (for example, to snails/slugs). You might have some blood tests, as well as tests for meningitis. Treatment The parasite dies over time, even without treatment. Even people who develop eosinophilic meningitis usually don’t need antiparasitics. Sometimes the symptoms of the infection last for several weeks or months, while the body’s immune system responds to the dying parasites. The most common types of treatment are for the symptoms of the infection, such as pain medication for headache or medications to reduce the body’s reaction to the parasite, rather than for the infection itself.

A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. Anyone who eats undercooked or raw fish or squid is at risk. You can prevent getting anisakiasis by not eating raw or undercooked fish or squid. Overview Anisakiasis (also known as herring worm disease) is a parasitic disease caused by nematodes (worms) that attach to the walls of the esophagus, stomach, or intestine. Anisakiasis is most commonly found in areas where eating raw fish is popular, such as Japan. Because eating undercooked fish is becoming more common, there have been cases in the US, Europe, South America, and other areas of the world. Signs and symptoms People with anisakiasis can experience signs and symptoms such as Abdominal pain Nausea Vomiting Abdominal distention (abnormal abdominal expansion) Diarrhea Blood and mucus in stool Mild fever People can also experience allergic reactions such as Rashes Itching Infrequently anaphylaxis (a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction) Some people experience a tingling sensation during or after eating raw or undercooked fish or squid. This sensation is actually the worm moving in the mouth or throat. People can often take the worm out of their mouth themselves or cough it up to prevent infection. Some people experience vomiting, which can often expel the worm from the body. How it spreads When certain infected marine mammals (e.g., whales or sea lions) defecate (poop) in the sea, they release eggs. These eggs become infective larvae while in the water. Crustaceans (e.g., crabs, lobsters, shrimps) consume the infective larvae, and then fish or squid consume the crustaceans. When humans eat raw or undercooked infected fish or squid, they consume the nematode larvae, which can invade the gastrointestinal tract. Eventually, the parasite dies and produces an inflamed mass in the esophagus, stomach, or intestine. People cannot spread anisakiasis to one another. Prevention To prevent anisakiasis, do not eat raw or undercooked fish or squid. Food precautions The FDA recommends the following for seafood preparation or storage to kill parasites: Cooking (Seafood in General) Cook seafood adequately (to an internal temperature of at least 145° F [~63° C]). Freezing (Fish) At -4°F (-20°C) or below for 7 days (total time), or At -31°F (-35°C) or below until\",\n",

The bacteria that causes anthrax occurs naturally in soil worldwide. People usually get anthrax from infected animals or contaminated animal products. Call a healthcare provider immediately if you think you have been exposed to anthrax. Overview Anthrax is a serious disease usually caused by Bacillus anthracis bacteria. The bacteria are found naturally in soil around the world and commonly affect livestock and wild animals. People usually get sick with anthrax if they come in contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products. People can breathe in anthrax spores, eat food or drink water contaminated with spores, or get spores in a cut or scrape in the skin. Livestock and wild animals can become infected when they breathe in, eat, or drink spores in contaminated soil, plants, or water. These animals can include cattle, sheep, goats, antelope, and deer. Anthrax is rare in the United States. However, occasional outbreaks do happen in wild and domestic grazing animals such as cattle or deer. In the United States, veterinarians recommend yearly vaccination of livestock in areas where animals have had anthrax in the past. Types The type of illness a person develops depends on how anthrax enters the body: through the skin, lungs, or gastrointestinal system. All types of anthrax can cause death if they're not treated with antibiotics. Cutaneous anthrax Cutaneous anthrax happens when anthrax spores get into a cut or scape on the skin when a person handles infected animals or contaminated animal products like wool, hides, or hair. It mostly shows up on the head, neck, forearms, and hands. It's the most common form of anthrax infection, and it's also considered to be the least dangerous.

It's the deadliest form of the disease. People who work in places such as wool mills, slaughterhouses, and tanneries may breathe in the spores when working with infected animals or contaminated animal products. Inhalation anthrax starts primarily in the lymph nodes in the chest before spreading throughout the rest of the body. View Larger Download Inhalation anthrax happens when people breathe in spores. Gastrointestinal anthrax This type of anthrax can happen when a person eats raw or undercooked meat from an infected animal. It has rarely been reported in the United States. It affects the upper gastrointestinal tract (throat and esophagus), stomach, and intestines, causing a wide variety of symptoms. View Larger Download Gastrointestinal anthrax occurs when a person consumes raw or undercooked meat from an infected animal. Injection anthrax Injection anthrax recently was identified in heroin-injecting drug users in northern Europe, but it hasn't been reported in the United States. Injection anthrax is similar to cutaneous anthrax and causes infection deep under the skin or in the muscle where the drug was injected. Did you know? Welder's anthrax is a newly identified and rare disease that has been found in several people who are welders or metalworkers. This disease causes severe pneumonia and can be fatal. If you are a welder or metalworker and you develop fever and chills with sudden cough, chest pain, difficulty breathing, or coughing up blood, see a healthcare provider immediately. About welder's anthrax Symptoms The symptoms of anthrax depend on the type of infection. Symptoms show up anywhere from one day to more than two months after you're exposed to the bacteria that cause anthrax. If you don't get proper treatment, all types of anthrax have the potential to spread through your body and cause severe illness and death. Cutaneous anthrax Cutaneous anthrax shows up as telltale black sores of anthrax infection. Symptoms include: Group of itchy, small blisters or bumps Large amount of swelling around the sore Painless sore commonly on the face, neck, arms, or hand that has a black center Sore appears after the bumps have gone down For injection anthrax, infected sores (abscesses) deep under the skin or muscle at the injection site Inhalation anthrax You can see extensive lung damage in the chest x-ray taken in a 46-year-old man 4 months after anthrax started. Symptoms include: Fever and chills Heavy sweats Chest pain, cough, or shortness of breath Confusion or dizziness Nausea, vomiting, or stomach pains Headache or body aches Extreme tiredness Gastrointestinal anthrax Symptoms include: Fever and chills Swelling of neck or neck glands Sore throat, hoarseness, and pain when swallowing Nausea and vomiting, especially bloody vomiting Diarrhea or bloody diarrhea Headache Red face and red eyes Stomach pain and swelling Fainting Risk factors Most people will never be exposed to anthrax.

Keep Reading Preventing Exposure to Anthrax at Certain Jobs Prevention If someone has been exposed to the bacteria that causes anthrax, doctors may recommend anthrax vaccine, or they may recommend taking certain antibiotics to prevent anthrax from developing. Keep Reading About Anthrax Prevention Antibiotics destroy the bacteria that cause anthrax. Taking antibiotics after exposure to the bacteria can help prevent you from getting anthrax. Diagnosing anthrax If you've been exposed to anthrax, see a healthcare provider immediately and explain how you may have been exposed. It's important to get medical care as quickly as possible to have the best chances for a full recovery. Doctors can prescribe antibiotics to prevent you from getting sick, or as treatment if you're already sick. There is no test to find out if you have been exposed to anthrax. Public health departments will have to do an investigation to see if and how you were exposed.

This is called post-exposure prophylaxis. If you think you've been exposed to anthrax, see a healthcare professional immediately. Overview Anthrax is rare, and most people will never be exposed to it. However, people with certain jobs, hobbies, and activities may have a greater risk of exposure. People could also be exposed to anthrax during a bioterrorism attack. Anthrax can be deadly if action isn't taken quickly after exposure. It is important to know how to protect yourself and others around you if you are exposed to anthrax, including during a bioterrorism event. Anthrax is not contagious, which means you can't catch it from another person like the cold or flu. Preventing anthrax before you're exposed Routine occupational use (before exposure) The anthrax vaccine is approved for adults ages 18 to 65 years in certain jobs. People who get the vaccine will get 5 shots over 18 months and will get yearly boosters for protection. Anthrax vaccine is recommended for people who hold the following jobs: Certain laboratory workers who work with anthrax Some members of the United States military People whose jobs are handling animals or animal products People with the following conditions should not get the vaccine before exposure: Pregnancy Serious allergic reaction to the anthrax vaccine Severe allergy to any part of the anthrax vaccine People with severe allergies should tell their doctor about their allergies before getting the vaccine. If anthrax vaccine is recommended or required by your employer because of your job responsibilities, you should ask your employer if they offer the vaccine or to refer you to a clinic in your community where the vaccine is available. You can also contact your state health department to learn more about where to get the vaccine in your community if it is recommended for you. Preventing anthrax if you're exposed Vaccine Sometimes anthrax vaccine is recommended for people who may have been exposed to anthrax.

       " \"health department to learn more about where to get the vaccine in your community if it is recommended for you. Preventing anthrax if you're exposed Vaccine Sometimes anthrax vaccine is recommended for people who may have been exposed to anthrax. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved emergency use of the vaccine after a possible anthrax exposure. This is called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). There are two types of anthrax vaccines approved by the FDA for people ages 18 to 65 after possible anthrax exposure: Anthrax vaccine is approved for use after exposure in people aged 18 to 65. In these situations, the vaccine is given after anthrax exposure to prevent the disease (post-exposure prophylaxis, or PEP). There are two types of anthrax vaccines approved by the FDA to use as PEP: Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed ( BioThrax® ), which consists of 3 shots of anthrax vaccine over 4 weeks Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed adjuvanted, which consists of 2 shots given 2 weeks apart In both cases, people exposed to anthrax will also get antibiotics for up to 60 days as an added precaution to prevent them from getting sick with anthrax. In an emergency, the only people who shouldn't get the vaccine are people with a past serious allergic reaction to the anthrax vaccine, or anyone who has an allergy to one of the ingredients in the vaccine. Your healthcare professional can tell you about the vaccine's ingredients. These individuals should take antibiotics for 60 days. Antibiotics The bacteria that cause anthrax can be prevented by taking certain antibiotics after exposure. This is another form of PEP. In an emergency If there is an anthrax emergency, you will likely be given an antibiotic because you may have breathed in anthrax bacteria. You may receive doxycycline (DOX-i-SYE-kleen) or ciprofloxacin (sip-roe-FLOX-a-sin). These medicines reduce your chance of getting sick and dying. Public health officials will provide information on who should get the medicine. It's important to take one of these medicines as soon as possible after the emergency starts. If you have questions, talk to a healthcare provider. People who may have breathed in anthrax bacteria should take one of the medicines twice a day for up to 60 days. Most people will be given a 10-day supply to start. Public health officials will tell you whether you need more and how to get it. To reduce your chance of getting sick, take the medicine as long as you are directed and don't stop it early.

Signs and symptoms include fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath, and coughing up blood. Researchers are working to find out the exact causes of welder's anthrax. If you think you might have welder's anthrax, see a doctor immediately. Overview Welder's anthrax is a newly identified, rare, and often deadly disease that affects metalworkers. Metalworkers with welder's anthrax have pneumonia caused by bacteria that produces anthrax toxin, but it isn't actually anthrax . Welder's anthrax and anthrax are treated similarly, but they are caused by slightly different bacteria and affect different people. CDC first identified welder's anthrax in 1994. From 1994-2024, 9 patients in the United States have been diagnosed with what is now called welder ' s anthrax. All of the patients were metalworkers, and 8 were welders. They all worked in either Texas or Louisiana. All patients were hospitalized, and those that survived past the emergency department were all admitted to the intensive care unit. Six of the 9 patients died. All patients admitted to the intensive care unit received antibiotic treatment, and 2 of the survivors also got anthrax antitoxin. Cases of welder's anthrax may have been missed because this newly recognized disease isn't widely understood or well known. Doctors may not know what patients do for a living and therefore don't test patients for this disease. Signs and symptoms People diagnosed with welder's anthrax had abnormal chest x-rays and were diagnosed with pneumonia. Signs and symptoms for welder's anthrax may be confused for a kind of anthrax called inhalation anthrax that affects the lungs. These include: Fever or chills Cough Shortness of breath Coughing up blood If you think you may have welder's anthrax See a healthcare provider immediately and tell the medical team that you're a metalworker or welder, especially if you worked in a U.S. Gulf Coast state (Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, or Texas). Who is at risk All patients diagnosed with welder's anthrax have been metalworkers, and most were welders.

       " \"(Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, or Texas). Who is at risk All patients diagnosed with welder's anthrax have been metalworkers, and most were welders. Researchers think the disease may be linked to exposure to metal fumes and iron oxide breathed in during welding. Welders and other workers exposed to metal fumes and mineral dusts have an increased risk of pneumonia and death. Exposure to metal fumes might increase the chance of lung infection, even with common, relatively harmless bacteria. We don't yet know how metal fumes cause disease. It's possible that metal fumes (or iron) help bacteria grow, help bacteria stick to lung tissues, or make it harder for your immune system to fight bacteria in the lungs. The amount of iron in the soil is much higher around welding sites than other places, but we need more research to understand how this affects the bacteria and possibly contributes to welder's anthrax. Prevention Welders and other metalworkers should be aware if they're potentially at risk on the job and how to protect themselves. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Hazard Communication Standard requires employers to inform and train workers on potential work dangers and safe practices, procedures, and protective measures. Steps for employers Employers can take steps to help prevent welder's anthrax using the hierarchy of controls . Conduct a hazard assessment for all welders, other metalworkers, and supervisors at worksites to prevent exposure to the bacteria that cause welder's anthrax. View Larger The hierarchy of controls can be used to prevent workplace exposure to welding fumes and gases, and soils that may be contaminated with the bacteria that causes welder's anthrax. 1. Elimination and substitution controls Elimination and substitution controls to help reduce exposure to welding fumes and gases and contaminated soil by: Using a less toxic welding type or consumable. Keeping welding surfaces free of any coatings, dirt, and dust that may lead to potentially toxic exposures. 2. Engineering controls Engineering controls can include the use of ventilation systems to remove fumes and gases. Do not assume that welding outdoors or in open areas provides enough ventilation, even when welders use proper positioning and natural drafts. Position local exhaust systems to draw fumes and gases away from workers in the area 3. Administrative controls Administrative controls include maintaining a clean and dirt-free worksite. Routinely clean with a vacuum equipped with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter or wet cleaning methods. Don't use compressed air or dry sweeping or brushing. Use dust control programs in outdoor workplaces and near workplaces open to the outdoors, and limit nearby activities that kick up dry dust. In busy areas, add water, hydroscopic compounds, or surfactants to roadways and surfaces to help control dirt and dust exposures. Don't apply these substances where welding occurs as this may create an electrocution hazard.

Spotlight Metalworkers can use personal protective equipment (PPE) including coveralls and work boots in the workplace to prevent their skin and clothing from being contaminated and taking it all home. If other methods don't help reduce your exposure to potentially contaminated dust, use NIOSH-approved respirators as part of protecting yourself from welder's anthrax and other diseases. Treatment and recovery People with welder's anthrax generally get the same treatments as people with anthrax, including antibiotics and anthrax antitoxin. The sooner they get treatment, the more likely they are to recover. It's very important to make sure that your healthcare providers know you may be at risk for welder's anthrax so they can test you for it and get you the right treatment. Most people with welder's anthrax have died because the disease wasn't recognized and patients weren't treated quickly.

Illness or injury may occur if workers’ normal anthropometric measurements are not considered in workplace designs and personal protective equipment. Definitions Anthropometry - the science that defines physical measures of a person's size, form, and functional capacities Functional capacity - the ability to complete certain work tasks based on human size or form How it works Anthropometric measurements are used to study the interaction of workers with tasks, tools, machines, vehicles, and personal protective equipment (PPE). These measurements are often used to determine the degree of protection against dangerous exposures, long term or short term. Many workers experience the benefit of applying anthropometric measurements. For example: Construction workers benefit from more than one size of fall harness. Truck drivers have a more ergonomic design of truck cabs. Firefighters have improved PPE for best fit. Police officers have improved uniform fit for more body types. Consider this Diverse workforces in many occupations require body-size data for designing adequate workplaces, systems, and PPE. Impacts Technological development in recent years has advanced the basic science of human size and shape studies in 3-dimensional (3D) forms. Computer-generated human models are now available for anthropometric analysis. These advances have made it possible to improve workplace and protective equipment design, and anthropometric fit within complex systems. Did you know? In applied anthropometry, collection and use of 3D anthropometric data have become a norm. This will ultimately result in a better fit between workers and their tools, systems, and work environments. Safety risks Designs that are incompatible with normal anthropometric measurements of a workforce may result in unwanted incidents. For example: The misfit of a heavy equipment cabin to a worker may create operator blind spots that expose workers on foot to struck-by injuries. Inadequate length or configuration of seatbelts may lead to non-use of seat belts, which affect post-crash survivability. When PPE does not fit correctly it cannot sufficiently protect workers from health and safety exposures or hazards. What the data shows Existing data on the size and shape of industrial workers is limited. There is a lack of anthropometric data for the general worker\",\n",
       " 'belts, which affect post-crash survivability. When PPE does not fit correctly it cannot sufficiently protect workers from health and safety exposures or hazards. What the data shows Existing data on the size and shape of industrial workers is limited. There is a lack of anthropometric data for the general worker population. Safety researchers have generally relied on data drawn from studies of military personnel. Most of these studies took place during the 1950s to 1970s. However, substantial anthropometric variability exists among the general worker population. They are quite different from the average military population. Industrial workers like agricultural, truck driver, and firefighter workforces, are also anthropometrically different from the average civilian population. 1 Resources Datasets Firefighter Anthropometry Datasets U.S. firefighter anthropometric information can be used to update specifications for fire apparatus and firefighter protective equipment.

Among other things, antineoplastic drugs can cause long-term organ damage, fertility issues, and even cancer. Learn about exposure risks and find resources about the dangers of antineoplastic agents. Overview of risk factors The adverse health effects associated with antineoplastic agents (cancer chemotherapy and cytotoxic drugs) in patients are well documented. The very nature of antineoplastic agents makes them harmful to healthy cells and tissues as well as the cancerous cells. Healthcare workers at risk For cancer patients with a life-threatening disease, there is great benefit to treatment with antineoplastic agents. However, for healthcare workers exposed to antineoplastic agents on the job, precautions are important to eliminate or reduce exposure. Pharmacists or nurses who prepare and/or administer these drugs have the highest potential for exposure to antineoplastic agents. Other healthcare workers at risk include: Physicians and operating room personnel. Shipping/receiving, custodial, laundry, and waste workers. Veterinary oncology workers. Health impacts In addition to acute or short-term effects related to treatment with antineoplastic agents, the following long-term or chronic effects have been documented: Liver and kidney damage. Bone marrow damage. Lung and heart damage. Infertility (temporary and permanent). Effects on reproduction and the developing fetus in pregnant women. Hearing impairment. Cancer. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) found a number of antineoplastic agents are associated with cancer in patients. IARC currently lists: Eleven agents and two combined therapies as Group 1 (human carcinogens). Twelve agents as Group 2A (probable human carcinogens). Eleven agents as Group 2B (possible human carcinogens).

Keep Reading Hazardous Drug Exposures in Healthcare Identifying exposures A number of studies have documented environmental and worker exposure to antineoplastic agents in healthcare settings. In addition, analytical methods, such as measuring the drugs and/or their metabolites in worker urine, help document worker exposure. Worker exposures Some of the following biological endpoints are used to evaluate worker exposure: Urine mutagenicity. Chromosomal damage. Sister chromatid exchange. Micronuclei induction. DNA damage. HPRT mutations. Thioether excretion. Environmental exposures Similar analytical methods measure the level of environmental contamination in the workplace. Although limited studies on air sampling exist, there have been numerous studies published on environmental wipe sampling for these drugs. Preventing exposures In September 2004, The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) published an Alert: Preventing Occupational Exposures to Antineoplastic and Other Hazardous Drugs in Health Care Settings, 2004 , (DHHS (NIOSH) Publication No. 2004-165) . This topic page is an expanded bibliography of related publications drawn from the published literature related to the Alert. Additional information on this topic can be found on the NIOSH Hazardous Drug Exposures in Healthcare page. Resources In addition to the resources below, you can explore the NIOSH Hazardous Drugs Resources page or see the NIOSHTIC-2 database search results on Antineoplastic Agents/Chemotherapy. NIOSHTIC-2 is a database of occupational safety and health publications funded in whole or in part by NIOSH. Decontamination and deactivation Several reports have dealt with methods for the decontamination and/or deactivation of antineoplastic agents. Although bleach (hypochlorite) is often recommended for the decontamination purposes, it is not effective with all classes of agents. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that cleaning with bleach solutions will destroy all types of antineoplastic agents. AIHA Healthcare Working Group Hazardous Drugs Project Team.

Evaluation of protective equipment The most often used type of protective equipment for handling antineoplastic agents is gloves. Typically, latex and other materials have been employed for this use. However, with the concern over latex allergies, newer materials are being marketed and evaluated for use with these agents. Protective gowns are another piece of equipment that is commonly used in the handling of antineoplastic agents. Alexander K, Northrup N, Clarke D, Lindell H and Laver T.

What it is Aortic aneurysms can dissect or rupture: The force of blood pumping can split the layers of the artery wall, allowing blood to leak in between them. This process is called a dissection . The aneurysm can burst completely, causing bleeding inside the body. This is called a rupture . Dissections and ruptures are the cause of most deaths from aortic aneurysms. A thoracic aortic aneurysm happens in the chest. An abdominal aortic aneurysm, which is more common, happens below the chest. Facts about aortic aneurysm in the United States Aortic aneurysms or aortic dissections were the cause of 9,904 deaths in 2019. 1 In 2019, about 59% of deaths due to aortic aneurysm or aortic dissection happen among men. 1 A history of smoking accounts for about 75% of all abdominal aortic aneurysms. 2 The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that men aged 65 to 75 years old who have ever smoked should get an ultrasound screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms, even if they have no symptoms. 3 Types Thoracic aortic aneurysm A thoracic aortic aneurysm happens in the chest. Men and women are equally likely to get thoracic aortic aneurysms, which become more common with increasing age. 4 Thoracic aortic aneurysms are usually caused by high blood pressure or sudden injury. Sometimes people with inherited connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, get thoracic aortic aneurysms. Signs and symptoms of thoracic aortic aneurysm can include\",\n",
       " \"aortic aneurysms, which become more common with increasing age. 4 Thoracic aortic aneurysms are usually caused by high blood pressure or sudden injury. Sometimes people with inherited connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, get thoracic aortic aneurysms. Signs and symptoms of thoracic aortic aneurysm can include the following: Sharp, sudden pain in the chest or upper back. Shortness of breath. Trouble breathing or swallowing. Abdominal aortic aneurysm An abdominal aortic aneurysm happens below the chest. Abdominal aortic aneurysms happen more often than thoracic aortic aneurysms. Abdominal aortic aneurysms are more common in men and among people age 65 and older. Abdominal aortic aneurysms are more common among White people than among Black people. 5 Abdominal aortic aneurysms are usually caused by atherosclerosis (hardened arteries), but infection or injury can also cause them. 6 Abdominal aortic aneurysms often don't have any symptoms. If an individual does have symptoms, they can include the following: Throbbing or deep pain in the back or side. Pain in the buttocks, groin, or legs. Other types Aneurysms can happen in other parts of your body. A ruptured aneurysm in the brain can cause a stroke . Peripheral aneurysms—those found in arteries other than the aorta—can happen in the neck, in the groin, or behind the knees. These aneurysms are less likely to rupture or dissect than aortic aneurysms, but they can form blood clots. These clots can break away and block blood flow through the artery. Risk factors Diseases and unhealthy behaviors that damage your heart and blood vessels also increase your risk for aortic aneurysm. Smoking is the most important behavior related to aortic aneurysm. Other factors include High blood pressure High blood cholesterol Atherosclerosis (hardened arteries) Some inherited connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, can also increase your risk for aortic aneurysm. Your family may also have a history of aortic aneurysms that can increase your risk. Treatment and recovery The two main treatments for aortic aneurysms are medicines and surgery . Medicines can lower blood pressure and reduce risk for an aortic aneurysm. Surgery can repair or replace the affected section of the aorta.

Signs and symptoms of arsine poisoning depend on exposure method and dose. If you were exposed, get clean and get medical care. Background Arsine is a colorless, flammable, non-irritating toxic gas with a mild garlic odor. Arsine is formed when arsenic comes in contact with an acid. Arsine is similar to a gas called stibine, which is formed when the metal antimony comes in contact with an acid. Stibine has health effects similar to those of arsine, but it is not as widely available. Stibine also has a noticeable \"rotten egg\" smell. Where it is found Arsine is most commonly used in the semiconductor and metals refining industries. Arsine was studied as a warfare agent during World War II, but it was never used on the battlefield. How it works After arsine enters the bloodstream, it damages the red blood cells. This can lead to symptoms of hemolytic anemia, when red blood cells die faster than the body can replace them. Signs and symptoms The effects of arsine poisoning depend on how much arsine a person was exposed to and how long the exposure was. Depending on the level of exposure to arsine, symptoms are likely to occur within the first 24 hours after exposure. Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to arsine. Exposure to low or moderate dose: Confusion, drowsiness, fatigue, and/or weakness Headache Muscle cramps Nausea, vomiting, and/or abdominal pain Rapid breathing or shortness of breath Red or dark urine Yellow skin and eyes (jaundice) Exposure to a large dose: Convulsions Loss of consciousness Paralysis Respiratory compromise, possibly leading to death Exposure Breathing in the gas is the most likely way of exposure after arsine is released into the air. Arsine is not absorbed into the body through the eyes and the skin. At lower amounts, people may not know they have been exposed to arsine, because it has no',\n",
       " 'death Exposure Breathing in the gas is the most likely way of exposure after arsine is released into the air. Arsine is not absorbed into the body through the eyes and the skin. At lower amounts, people may not know they have been exposed to arsine, because it has no smell. At higher amounts, a mild garlic smell (however, do not rely on this as a warning). On the other hand, stibine has a strong smell, so people may notice that they may have been exposed. Most reports of exposure are when arsine is accidentally made in the workplace. Arsine gas is heavier than air, so it would be more likely to settle in lower areas. What to do if you are exposed Because there is no cure for arsine exposure, the best thing to do is avoid it. First, get fresh air by leaving the area where the arsine is. Moving to an area with fresh air is a good way to reduce the possibility of death from arsine. If arsine was released outside, move away from the area. If arsine was released indoors, get out of the building. Evacuate or \"shelter in place\" If you are near an arsine release, emergency teams may tell you to evacuate the area or \"shelter in place\" inside. For more information on evacuation during a chemical emergency, visit \" Responding to Evacuation .\" For more information on sheltering in place during a chemical emergency, visit \" Responding to Sheltering in Place .\" When immediate care is needed\\u200e If you think you were exposed, take your clothes off, wash your body, and get medical care as quickly as possible. Take off your clothes Remove the clothing as quickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of pulling it over the head. If you are helping others, do not touch unsafe areas. Wash your body Wash any arsine from your skin with lots of soap and water. Washing with soap and water will protect you from any chemicals on your body. If your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes. If you wear contacts, remove them and put them with the dirty clothing. Do not put the contacts back in your eyes (even if they are not disposable contacts). If you wear eyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. You can put your eyeglasses back on after you wash them. Throw your clothes away After you have washed yourself, place your clothing inside a plastic bag. Do not touch unsafe areas of the clothing. If you have to touch unsafe areas, or you aren\\'t sure where the unsafe areas are, wear rubber gloves. You can also use tongs, tool handles, sticks, or similar objects to put the clothing in the bag. Anything that touches the dirty clothing should also be placed in the bag. If you wear contacts, put them in the plastic bag, too. Tie the bag, and then put that bag',\n",
       " 'You can also use tongs, tool handles, sticks, or similar objects to put the clothing in the bag. Anything that touches the dirty clothing should also be placed in the bag. If you wear contacts, put them in the plastic bag, too. Tie the bag, and then put that bag inside another plastic bag. Throwing away your clothes this way helps protect you and others from any chemicals that might be on your clothes. When the local or state health department or emergency team arrive, tell them what you did with your clothes. The health department or emergency team will arrange for further disposal. Do not handle the plastic bags yourself. For more information about cleaning your body and throwing away your clothes after a chemical exposure, visit \" About Getting Clean .\" Treatment Treatment involves providing supportive medical care in a hospital. Blood transfusions (transferring blood) and intravenous fluids (fluids injected directly into a vein) may be needed. Some people may need to have their blood cleaned by a machine if their kidneys fail. This process is called dialysis. Long-term health effects If people survive the first exposure, long-term effects may include: Kidney damage Numbness and pain in the hands and feet Neuropsychological symptoms (memory loss, confusion, and irritability) More information Facts About Arsine Case Definition: Arsine or Stibine Poisoning Toxic Syndrome Description: Arsine or Stibine Poisoning You can contact one of the following: Regional poison control center: 1-800-222-1222 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Public Response Hotline: 800-CDC-INFO Teletypewriter (TTY): 888-232-6348 E-mail inquiries: cdcinfo@cdc.gov On This Page Background Where it is found How it works Signs and symptoms Exposure What to do if you are exposed Treatment Long-term health effects More information September 6, 2024 Sources Print Share Facebook LinkedIn Twitter Syndicate Content Source: National Center for Environmental Health Sources National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH) Chemical Emergencies If a chemical emergency happens, take steps to protect yourself and your loved ones View All For Everyone About How to Respond Pets Chemical Fact Sheets Health Care Providers Resources for Medical Professionals Impacts on Breastfeeding Public Health Resources Sign up for Email Updates Contact Us Contact Us Call 800-232-4636 Contact CDC About CDC About CDC Pressroom Organization Budget & Funding Careers & Jobs Policies Accessibility External Links Privacy Web Policies FOIA OIG No Fear Act Nondiscrimination Vulnerability Disclosure Policy Languages Languages EspaÃ±ol Language Assistance EspaÃ±ol ç¹\\x81é«\\x94ä¸\\xadæ\\x96\\x87 Tiáº¿ng Viá»\\x87t í\\x95\\x9cêµ\\xadì\\x96´ Tagalog Ð Ñ\\x83Ñ\\x81Ñ\\x81ÐºÐ¸Ð¹ Ø§Ù\\x84Ø¹Ø±Ø¨Ù\\x8aØ© KreyÃ²l Ayisyen FranÃ§ais Polski PortuguÃªs Italiano Deutsch æ\\x97¥æ\\x9c¬èª\\x9e Ù\\x81Ø§Ø±Ø³Û\\x8c English Archive CDC Archive Public Health Publications Contact Us Contact Us Call 800-232-4636 Contact CDC About CDC Pressroom Organization Budget & Funding Careers & Jobs About CDC Policies Accessibility External Links Privacy Web Policies FOIA OIG No Fear Act Nondiscrimination Vulnerability Disclosure Policy Languages Languages EspaÃ±ol Language Assistance EspaÃ±ol ç¹\\x81é«\\x94ä¸\\xadæ\\x96\\x87 Tiáº¿ng Viá»\\x87t í\\x95\\x9cêµ\\xadì\\x96´ Tagalog Ð Ñ\\x83Ñ\\x81Ñ\\x81ÐºÐ¸Ð¹ Ø§Ù\\x84Ø¹Ø±Ø¨Ù\\x8aØ© KreyÃ²l Ayisyen FranÃ§ais Polski PortuguÃªs Italiano Deutsch æ\\x97¥æ\\x9c¬èª\\x9e Ù\\x81Ø§Ø±Ø³Û\\x8c English Archive CDC Archive Public Health Publications HHS.gov USA.gov',\n",

Most people get better on their own without treatment, but it can be very serious. Learn when to seek medical care for meningitis. What it is Meningitis is an inflammation (swelling) of the protective lining of the brain and spinal cord that can be caused by a viral infection. Many viruses can cause meningitis. Leading U.S. causes include: Arboviruses, such as West Nile virus Herpesviruses Epstein-Barr virus Herpes simplex viruses Varicella-zoster virus (which causes chickenpox and shingles ) Influenza virus Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus Measles virus Mumps virus Non-polio enteroviruses (most common) Symptoms People with viral meningitis usually start having typical meningitis symptoms . When to seek emergency care Anyone with symptoms of meningitis should see a healthcare provider right away. A healthcare provider can determine if you have meningitis, what's causing it, and the best treatment. Risk factors Anyone can get viral meningitis. However, the following factors can increase someone's risk. Age Children younger than 5 years old are at increased risk for viral meningitis. Babies younger than 1 month old are most likely to have severe illness if they get viral meningitis. Medical conditions People with a weakened immune system are at increased risk for getting viral meningitis and having severe illness. Diseases, some medications (such as chemotherapy), and recent organ or bone marrow transplantations can weaken the immune system. Close contacts aren't likely to develop meningitis Close contacts of someone with viral meningitis can become infected with the virus that made that person sick. They aren't likely to develop meningitis though. How it spreads Learn how viruses that cause meningitis spread: Arboviruses, such as West Nile virus Herpesviruses Epstein-Barr virus Herpes simplex viruses Varicella-zoster virus (which causes chickenpox and shingles ) Influenza virus Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus Measles virus Mumps virus Non-polio enteroviruses (most common) Prevention Limit virus exposure and spread Many daily healthy habits can help prevent viral infections: Wash your hands often, especially after changing diapers or using the toilet.

See more information on the definition of ART below. Overview In general, ART procedures involve surgically removing eggs from a woman's ovaries, combining them with sperm in the laboratory, and returning them to a female patient or a gestational carrier. ART also includes egg and embryo cryopreservation (freezing) and egg and embryo donation. The most common type of ART is in vitro fertilization (IVF). Other types of ART, such as gamete intrafallopian transfer or zygote intrafallopian transfer, are rarely performed. ART does NOT include treatments in which only sperm are handled (such as intrauterine insemination). It also does NOT include procedures in which a woman takes drugs only to stimulate egg production without planning to have the eggs surgically retrieved.

CDC uses Certificates of Confidentiality and other resources to protect identifiable and potentially identifiable information. Overview Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) commits to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of the information we have, in accordance with federal laws. The Privacy and Confidentiality Unit (PCU) provides guidance on privacy and confidentiality for all federally funded and supported activities through consultation and issuance of Assurances of Confidentiality to CDC programs. Privacy CDC provides technical support and education to CDC employees; grantees; partners; and state, Tribal, and local health departments on: The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Other federal privacy laws. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) The HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR Parts 160 and 164 ) regulates the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, called protected health information (PHI), by covered entities. The Privacy Rule protects all PHI transmitted or maintained in any form or medium (e.g. electronic, paper, or oral) by a covered entity or its business associates. It excludes certain educational and employment records. The Privacy Rule gives individuals certain rights in respect to their health information including, but not limited to, the right to inspect and request corrections or amendments to their PHI. The Privacy Rule requires covered entities to notify individuals of their privacy rights and how their PHI will be used and disclosed. The Privacy Rule generally prohibits the use or disclosure of PHI without the written authorization from the individual; however, there are several exceptions to this requirement including disclosures for public health activities. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. §1232g; 34 CFR Part 99 ) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records.

       " \"Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. §1232g; 34 CFR Part 99 ) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. Health care information is generally part of the education record. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education. FERPA gives parents certain rights regarding their child's education record. These rights include the right to inspect and request corrections to the record. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school level. FERPA generally prohibits the disclosure of any personally identifiable information contained in an education record without the appropriate written consent. FERPA offers limited exceptions to this requirement. Confidentiality Certificates of Confidentiality Certificates of Confidentiality (CoCs) protect the privacy of research participants by prohibiting disclosure of identifiable and potentially identifiable research information, with limited exceptions. Any investigator or institution issued a CoC shall not: Disclose or provide covered information, in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceeding. Disclose or provide covered information to any other person not connected with the research. CDC investigators with a CoC may ONLY disclose identifiable and potentially identifiable information in the following circumstances: If required by other federal, state, or local laws, such as for reporting of communicable diseases. If the subject consents. For the purposes of scientific research that is compliant with human subjects' regulations. CoCs cover any CDC-funded research project collecting or using identifiable and potentially identifiable information, in compliance with Section 301(d) of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). All CDC-funded research activities are automatically issued a CoC through their award. No physical certificate will be issued. The CoC will apply as a term and condition of award. This applies to: Grants. Cooperative Agreements. Contracts. CDC-sponsored intramural research. For research activities enrolling human participants, CDC requires investigators to inform participants of the CoC protections and the limits to those protections. Assurance of Confidentiality An Assurance of Confidentiality (AoC) is a formal confidentiality protection authorized under Section 308(d) of the PHSA. CDC investigators use it to collect or maintain sensitive identifiable information from individuals and institutions. The law states that no identifiable information may be used for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was supplied. The exception is if such institution or individual consented to that disclosure. Protected information includes identifiable information on institutions or individuals who are the subjects of non-research, public health activities with an approved AoC. CDC implements agency AoC protection for public health activities conducted by CDC investigators that involve the collection or maintenance of identifiable information. This protection allows CDC programs to assure individuals and institutions involved in non-research activities (e.g., surveillance) that those conducting the activity will protect the confidentiality of the identifiable data collected. Disclosures can be made without individual authorization only for purposes stated at the time of data collection or specifically consented to thereafter by each of the parties\",\n",

During an asthma attack, a person with asthma can experience symptoms such as wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and nighttime or early morning coughing. Often, asthma attacks can be prevented by limiting one\\'s exposure to triggers and by properly using asthma medications. Keep Reading Asthma Flu and people with asthma People with asthma can develop swollen and sensitive airways, and flu can cause further inflammation of the airways and lungs. Flu can trigger asthma attacks and cause worsening of asthma symptoms. Flu also can lead to pneumonia and other acute respiratory diseases. In fact, adults and children with asthma are more likely to develop pneumonia after getting sick with flu than people who do not have asthma. Asthma is the most common medical condition among children hospitalized with flu and one of the more common medical conditions among adults hospitalized with flu. Prevention A flu shot is the best protection against flu Flu vaccination is especially important for people with asthma because they are at higher risk of developing serious flu complications. Keep Reading Benefits of flu vaccination Flu vaccines for people with asthma Most injectable influenza vaccines (or flu shots) are approved for use in people 6 months and older, regardless of whether or not they have asthma or other health conditions. Flu shots have a long-established safety record in people with asthma. People with asthma should generally not receive the nasal spray flu vaccine (i.e., the live attenuated influenza vaccine or LAIV). People with asthma who are aged 5 years and older, talk to your health care provider before getting the nasal spray vaccine. Children 2 to 4 years old who have asthma or who have had a history of wheezing in the past 12 months should not get the nasal spray vaccine. Pneumococcal vaccination is also important Having flu increases your risk of getting pneumococcal disease . Pneumococcal pneumonia is an example of a serious flu-related complication that can cause death. People who have asthma should also be up to date with pneumococcal vaccination . This vaccination helps protect against pneumococcal pneumonia and other serious infections. You can get the pneumococcal vaccine your provider recommends when you get a flu vaccine. Talk to your health care provider to find out which pneumococcal vaccines are recommended for you. Keep Reading Pneumococcal Vaccination Specific health actions for people with asthma Take asthma medication exactly as your doctor or other medical professional tells you to do. Know how to use your asthma inhaler if your doctor or other medical professional tells you to use one. Plan ahead to maintain sufficient supplies of your regular medications for chronic medical conditions (e.g., at least a two-week supply). Know and avoid the',\n",

Plan ahead to maintain sufficient supplies of your regular medications for chronic medical conditions (e.g., at least a two-week supply). Know and avoid the asthma triggers that can cause you to have an asthma attack. Follow an updated, written Asthma Action Plan developed with your health care provider. Follow this Asthma Action Plan for daily treatment to control asthma long-term and to handle worsening asthma, or attacks. If your child has asthma, make sure that their up-to-date written Asthma Action Plan is on file at school and/or at the daycare center. Be sure that the plan and medication(s) are easy to get to when needed. Other preventive actions In addition to getting a flu vaccine, people with asthma should take the same everyday preventive actions CDC recommends for everyone , including avoiding people who are sick, covering coughs, and washing hands often. This also can include taking steps for cleaner air and hygiene practices like cleaning frequently touched surfaces. Keep Reading Preventing Respiratory Illnesses Symptoms and treatment Because you are at higher risk of developing serious flu complications, if you get sick with flu symptoms call your health care provider right away. There are antiviral drugs that can treat flu illness and help prevent serious flu complications. Influenza antiviral drugs are medicines that fight against flu by keeping influenza viruses from making more viruses in your body. People with asthma should not use the antiviral drug zanamivir (trade name Relenza®) because there is a risk it may cause wheezing in people with asthma or other lung problems.

Work-related asthma is triggered or develops from exposures at work. Workplace irritants, allergens, and physical conditions are triggers. Work-related asthma symptoms are the same as non-work related asthma. Overview Work-related asthma is asthma triggered by exposures at work. Asthma affects the lungs and causes the airways to become narrow and inflamed. To control it, avoid triggers that cause asthma symptoms and take prescribed medicine. Many triggers can be in the workplace. Over 300 known substances in the workplace can cause or worsen asthma. Avoiding triggers can prevent asthma from getting worse. Worsening asthma or new onset asthma in a worker should raise questions about workplace causes. Asthma symptoms can develop shortly after exposure. However, they can also develop months or years after repeated exposures to harmful substances. Signs and symptoms Coughing at work can be a symptom of work-related asthma. Symptoms of work-related asthma are the same as symptoms for non-work-related asthma. They include: Wheezing Coughing Chest tightness Shortness of breath Asthma symptoms can come and go, and some workers might not have all of the symptoms. Workers can get work-related asthma even when using personal protective equipment such as respirators or face masks. Sometimes breathing problems start at work and continue after leaving work when exposure has stopped. How do I know if I have work-related asthma? Symptoms for work-related asthma tend to get better on weekends, vacations, or other times when away from work. However, in some cases, symptoms do not improve until extended time away from exposures or triggers. Your doctor can diagnose work-related asthma. Tell your doctor about work exposures and possible triggers including your job, tasks, and materials you use. Also consider recording when and where your symptoms occur to help determine any patterns. Your doctor will ask questions about your symptoms and will conduct a physical examination. The doctor might also order one or more tests, such as: Breathing tests (e.g., peak flow readings, spirometry, methacholine challenge) Allergy tests such as\",\n",

The doctor might also order one or more tests, such as: Breathing tests (e.g., peak flow readings, spirometry, methacholine challenge) Allergy tests such as skin or blood tests If your doctor is concerned about a condition other than asthma, he/she might order other tests such as x-rays or other imaging tests. Causes Exposures from indoor water damage can trigger work-related asthma. Work-related asthma is associated with exposure to worksite triggers (irritants, allergens, and physical conditions). Examples of asthma triggers are: Animal dander, insects, and dust mites Chlorine-based cleaning products Cigarette smoke Materials from cockroaches Cold air Dust from wood, grain, flour, or green coffee beans Gases such as ozone Other possible triggers include: Irritant chemicals Metal dust Physical exertion Pollen and plants Strong fumes Vapors from chemicals (e.g., ammonia, isocyanates, and solvents) Wood smoke Symptom management Inhalers are often used to treat asthma attacks. The most important step of managing asthma is stopping or reducing exposure to triggers causing symptoms. Work with your doctor to develop a personal asthma control plan. Medical professionals often treat asthma with two general types of medicine: Quick -relief rescue inhalers (e.g., albuterol, levalbuterol) to open the airways. People use these medicines to treat asthma attacks or flare-ups. Quick relief medications are often used in combination with long-term control medicines such inhaled corticosteroids. Lo ng-term control medicines to reduce inflammation in the airways. People use these medicines to help keep asthma symptoms from occurring. When these medicines are working well, quick relief medicine is not used as much.

Some people who have AFib don’t know they have it and don’t have any symptoms. What it is Atrial fibrillation, often called AFib or AF, is the most common type of treated heart arrhythmia. An arrhythmia is when the heart beats too slowly, too fast, or in an irregular way. When a person has AFib, the normal beating in the upper chambers of the heart (the two atria) is irregular, and blood doesn't flow as well as it should from the atria to the lower chambers of the heart (the two ventricles). AFib may happen in brief episodes, or it may be a permanent condition. This illustration shows a normal heartbeat and an irregular heartbeat. Facts about AFib It is estimated that 12.1 million people in the US will have AFib in the US will have AFib by 2050. 1 2 In 2021, AFib was mentioned on 232,030 death certificates and was the underlying cause of death in 28,037 of those deaths. 3 People of European descent are more likely to have AFib than Black people. Because the number of AFib cases increases with age and women generally live longer than men, more women than men experience AFib. Symptoms Some people who have AFib don't know they have it and don't have any symptoms. Others may experience one or more of the following symptoms: Irregular heartbeat. Heart palpitations (rapid, fluttering, or pounding). Lightheadedness. Extreme fatigue. Shortness of breath. Chest pain. Risk factors The risk for AFib increases with age. High blood pressure,\",\n",

Heart palpitations (rapid, fluttering, or pounding). Lightheadedness. Extreme fatigue. Shortness of breath. Chest pain. Risk factors The risk for AFib increases with age. High blood pressure, the risk for which also increases with advancing age, accounts for about 1 in 5 cases of AFib. 4 Risk factors for AFib include: 4 5 Advancing age. High blood pressure. Obesity. European ancestry. Diabetes. Heart failure. Ischemic heart disease. Hyperthyroidism. Chronic kidney disease. Moderate to heavy alcohol use. Smoking. Enlargement of the chambers on the left side of the heart. How is AFib related to stroke? AFib increases a person's risk for stroke. When standard stroke risk factors were accounted for, AFib was associated with an approximately fivefold increased risk of ischemic stroke. 6 AFib causes about 1 in 7 strokes. 7 Strokes caused by complications from AFib tend to be more severe than strokes with other underlying causes. Strokes happen when blood flow to the brain is blocked by a blood clot or by fatty deposits called plaque in the blood vessel lining. Treatment and recovery Treatment for AFib can include: Medicines to control the heart's rhythm and rate. Blood-thinning medicine to prevent blood clots from forming and reduce stroke risk. Surgery. Medicine and healthy lifestyle changes to manage AFib risk factors. What are the consequences of AFib? More than 454,000 hospitalizations with AFib as the primary diagnosis happen each year in the US. 4 The condition contributes to about 158,000 deaths each year. 3 The death rate from AFib as the primary or a contributing cause of death has been rising for more than two decades. 7 View Larger The map shows that concentrations of counties with the highest Cardiac Dysrhythmia Hospitalization Rates are located primarily in Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky North Carolina, West Virginia, Ohio, and Michigan. Pockets of high-rate counties also were found in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Missouri, Illinois, Tennessee, South Carolina, Indiana, Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Vermont, and Maine.

In July 1999, the Public Health Service agencies, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and vaccine manufacturers agreed that thimerosal should be reduced or eliminated in vaccines as a precautionary measure. Overview About thimerosal Mercury is a naturally occurring element found in the earth's crust, air, soil, and water. Two types of mercury to which people may be exposed — methylmercury and ethylmercury — are very different. In the United States, federal guidelines keep as much methylmercury as possible out of the environment and food, but over a lifetime, everyone is exposed to some methylmercury. Purpose of thimerosal Thimerosal is added to vials of vaccine that contain more than one dose (multi-dose vials) to prevent growth of germs, like bacteria and fungi. Introduction of bacteria and fungi has the potential to occur when a syringe needle enters a vial as a vaccine is being prepared for administration. Contamination by germs in a vaccine could cause severe local reactions, serious illness or death. In some vaccines, preservatives, including thimerosal, are added during the manufacturing process to prevent germ growth. Removal of thimerosal Fact Thimerosal was taken out of childhood vaccines in the United States in 2001. Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccines do not and never did contain thimerosal. Varicella (chickenpox), inactivated polio (IPV), and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have also never contained thimerosal. Influenza (flu) vaccines are currently available in both thimerosal-containing (for multi-dose vaccine vials) and thimerosal-free versions. For a complete list of vaccines and their thimerosal content level, see the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Thimerosal in Vaccines page. What the research shows The most common side-effects of thimerosal in vaccines are minor reactions like redness and swelling at the injection site. Although rare, some people\",\n",

What the research shows The most common side-effects of thimerosal in vaccines are minor reactions like redness and swelling at the injection site. Although rare, some people may be allergic to thimerosal. No connection with autism Research does not show any link between thimerosal in vaccines and autism , a neurodevelopmental disorder. Many well conducted studies have concluded that thimerosal in vaccines does not contribute to the development of autism. 1 2 3 Even after thimerosal was removed from almost all childhood vaccines, autism rates continued to increase, which is the opposite of what would be expected if thimerosal caused autism. Fact A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has shown that prenatal and infant exposure to vaccines and immunoglobulins that contain thimerosal does not increase risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). 1 No association with neuropsychological delays Studies have assessed the possible association between ethyl mercury exposure from thimerosal-containing vaccines and neuropsychological functioning including an objective measurement of neuropsychological functioning. Fact Research shows no association between thimerosal exposure and neuropsychological delays. 4 5 Timeline: Thimerosal in Vaccines 2010 September 13. Results of a CDC study do not support an association between prenatal and infant exposure to vaccines and immunoglobulins that contain thimerosal and an increased risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). 2009 February 1. Results of an Italian study were reassuring that immunization in infancy with thimerosal-containing vaccines does not decrease neuropsychological performance later in childhood. 2007 September 27. Results of a CDC study do not support an association between early exposure to thimerosal in vaccines and neuropsychological problems in children between the ages of 7 and 10 years. July 7. CDC issues a statement on autism and thimerosal that states in part: “Some people believe increased exposure to thimerosal (from the addition of important vaccines recommended for children) explains the higher prevalence [of autism] in recent years. However, evidence from several studies examining trends in vaccine use and changes in autism frequency does not support such an association.” 2006 September 26. In a statement prepared for the Coalition for Mercury-free Drugs, the FDA concludes that the evidence reviewed by the IOM in 2004 does not support an association between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. 2004 May 28. ACIP recommends that children between the ages of 6 and 23 months routinely receive an inactivated influenza (flu) vaccine. ACIP does not recommend using the thimerosal-free flu vaccine over the thimerosal-containing flu vaccine, and states that the benefits of flu vaccination outweigh any risk from thimerosal exposure. May 17. After reviewing over 200 scientific studies that examined thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism, IOM concludes in a report that the studies “consistently provided evidence of no association between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism.” 2003 November. A study finds no consistent significant associations between exposure to thimerosal-containing vaccines and a variety of kidney, nervous system, and developmental problems.',\n",

Another study looks for a link between autism incidence and the use of thimerosal-containing vaccines. The study does not find a link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism in Denmark and Sweden, where autism rates continued to increase although thimerosal was removed from vaccines in 1992. January. The last children’s vaccines that use thimerosal as a preservative expire . 2001 Except for influenza (flu), thimerosal is removed from or reduced in all vaccines routinely recommended for children 6 years of age and under manufactured for the U.S. market. October 1. IOM’s Immunization Safety Review Committee issues a report concluding there is not enough evidence to disprove claims that thimerosal in childhood vaccines causes autism, attention deficit hypersensitivity disorder, or speech or language delay. May 5. A risk assessment of thimerosal use in childhood vaccines finds no evidence of harm from the use of thimerosal as a preservative, other than redness and swelling at the injection site. 2000 June 7 and 8. Fifty-one vaccine and vaccine safety researchers and experts meet in Atlanta, GA to review data regarding thimerosal in vaccines and nervous system disorders. A report summarizing the meeting was presented to ACIP. 1999 The FDA reviews the use of thimerosal in childhood vaccines and finds no evidence of harm, but as a precautionary measure, recommends removing thimerosal from vaccines routinely given to infants. November 5. CDC states that vaccine manufacturers, FDA, and other agencies are working together to reduce the amount of thimerosal in vaccines, or to replace them with thimerosal-free vaccines, as soon as possible. October 20. ACIP reviews information about thimerosal in vaccines provided by CDC’s National Immunization Program and several vaccine manufacturers regarding the availability of vaccines that do not contain thimerosal as a preservative. July 7. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Public Health Service issue a joint statement that says “There is no data or evidence of any harm caused by the level of exposure that some children may have encountered in following the existing immunization schedule.” The American Academy of Family Physicians issues a comparable statement soon after. Frequently asked questions What is thimerosal? Thimerosal is a vaccine additive, added to some vaccines to prevent germs (like bacteria and fungi) from growing in them. If germs grow in vaccines, they can cause illness—or even death. Why do some people worry about thimerosal in vaccines? You may have heard that thimerosal has mercury in it. Not all types of mercury are the same. Some types of mercury, like mercury in some kinds of fish, stay in the human body and can make people sick. Thimerosal is a different kind of mercury.

Thimerosal is a different kind of mercury. It doesn’t stay in the body, and is unlikely to make us sick. Is thimerosal safe? Yes. Thimerosal has been used safely in vaccines for a long time (since the 1930s). Scientists have been studying the use of thimerosal in vaccines for many years. They haven’t found any evidence that thimerosal causes harm. Is thimerosal still used in vaccines for children? No. Thimerosal hasn't been used in vaccines for children since 2001. However, thimerosal is still used in some flu vaccines . Yearly flu vaccines are recommended for all children. If you are worried about thimerosal, you can ask for a flu vaccine without it. Does thimerosal cause autism? No. Research does not show any link between thimerosal and autism. Keep Reading Vaccines and Autism Are there side effects from thimerosal in vaccines? Most people don't have any side effects from thimerosal, but some people will have mild side effects like redness and swelling at the place where the shot was given, which will only last 1 to 2 days. It's very unlikely you will have an allergic reaction to thimerosal. How can I find out if thimerosal is in a vaccine? Ask your doctor or pharmacist. Ask to see the vaccine's list of ingredients. All vaccine packages come with information (called an insert) that lists the ingredients. See Also Thimerosal and Vaccines What CDC is doing Fact CDC and FDA closely monitor the safety of all vaccines. CDC and FDA are committed to monitoring the safety of vaccines. Once vaccines are licensed or authorized by FDA for use in the United States, CDC, FDA, and other federal agencies work together to monitor them using several safety systems.

Bird flu viruses do not normally infect humans. However, the disease can infect unprotected people who work with infected animals, or contaminated materials or surfaces. This page provides information for people with exposure to wild or domesticated birds. Overview Current Situation This page focuses on protecting people with exposure to wild or domesticated birds . If you're looking for information on the ongoing multi-state outbreak, please view the current situation summary . Infected birds shed virus in their saliva, mucous, and feces. Human infections with bird flu viruses are rare. Workers can get infected if they breathe in virus in the air. They can also get infected if they touch something with virus on it and then touch their mouth, eyes, or nose. People may be exposed to the virus if they work with: Infected wild birds or poultry that are sick or dead Infected birds' droppings Contaminated litter Contaminated materials or surfaces like egg collection containers At-risk populations Workers at risk Broiler breeder farms, hatcheries, grow-out farms, and processing plant workers Layer farm workers Turkey farm workers Disease control and eradication workers (federal, contract, and company workers) Live-bird market workers Wildlife biologists who handle birds Animal control, welfare, and rescue workers who handle infected animals Areas at risk Outbreaks occur occasionally around the world. Outbreaks in poultry were associated with illness and death in humans in Asia, Africa, Europe, the Pacific, and the Near East.

B virus can spread from infected macaque monkeys to people. If you are exposed to a macaque monkey, begin first aid immediately and see a healthcare provider. What it is B virus infection is extremely rare. However, it can lead to severe brain damage or death if you do not get treatment immediately. People typically get infected with B virus if they are bitten or scratched by an infected macaque monkey; or have contact with the monkey's eyes, nose, or mouth. Signs and symptoms Symptoms typically start within one month of being exposed to B virus. However, they could appear in as little as 3 to 7 days. The first indications of B virus infection are typically flu-like symptoms, like fever and chills. Then, you may develop small blisters in the wound or area on your body that had contact with the monkey. As the disease progresses, the virus spreads to and causes inflammation (swelling) of the brain and spinal cord. Problems with breathing and death can occur one day to three weeks after symptoms appear. Keep Reading: B Virus Symptoms and Complications Who is at risk Most people will not come in contact with monkeys, so their risk of getting infected with B virus is very low. However, laboratory workers, veterinarians, and people more likely exposed to macaque monkeys have a higher risk of getting B virus infection. Keep Reading: Risk Factors for B Virus How it spreads B virus can spread from infected macaque monkeys to people.

       " \"people. You can get infected with B virus if you: Are bitten or scratched by an infected monkey. Get an infected monkey's tissue or fluid on your broken skin or in your eyes, nose, or mouth. Have a needle stick by a contaminated syringe. Scratch or cut yourself on a contaminated cage or other sharp-edged surface. Are exposed to the brain (especially), spinal cord, or skull of an infected monkey. Keep Reading: B Virus: Causes and How It Spreads Prevention There are no vaccines that can protect you against B virus infection. If you are in a place with macaque monkeys, stay away from them so that you don't get bitten or scratched. You should not touch or feed monkeys. People at increased risk should follow appropriate laboratory and animal facility protocols to reduce the spread of B virus. Treatment and recovery Get first aid immediately\\u200e If you are exposed to a macaque monkey, get first aid and seek immediate medical attention. Follow the steps below. Thoroughly wash the wound or area on your body that had contact with the monkey and gently scrub with soap, detergent, or iodine for 15 minutes. Run water over the wound or area for 15 to 20 minutes more. Tell the healthcare provider that you have been exposed to a macaque monkey that may be infected with B virus. If you got exposed to a macaque, wash right away and tell your doctor. Medications If your healthcare provider determines that you need treatment for B virus exposure or infection, you may be given antiviral medications. Timely first aid and treatment for high-risk exposures is crucial to preventing life-threatening disease. How animals are affected Macaque monkeys housed in primate facilities usually become infected with B virus by the time they reach adulthood. However, even when they are infected with B virus, monkeys typically do not have symptoms, or have just mild disease.

Good infection control practices, including around the use of water, can help reduce infection risk. B. cepacia germs can be resistant to antibiotics, making them difficult to treat. What it is Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) is a group of bacteria commonly found in soil and water. Symptoms Symptoms vary, ranging from no symptoms to serious respiratory infections, especially in patients with cystic fibrosis or other chronic lung disease. Other symptoms may include: Fever Fatigue At-risk populations In the United States, people in healthcare settings and those with weakened immune systems or chronic lung diseases, particularly cystic fibrosis, are at highest risk of infection with B. cepacia complex. B. cepacia complex poses little medical risk to healthy people. How it spreads Exposure from water, soil or aqueous (watery) environments. Contact with contaminated surfaces. Contact with contaminated equipment. Person-to-person transmission, more commonly in patients with cystic fibrosis. Reducing risk Patients and caregivers Keep their hands clean , particularly before and after caring for wounds or touching a medical device. Ask others to clean their hands before touching the patient or handling medical devices. Avoid exposing wounds and indwelling medical devices (devices put in or connected to the patient's body) to nonsterile water. Allow healthcare staff to clean their room daily when in a healthcare setting. Healthcare providers Healthcare providers should always follow recommended infection control practices to reduce the risk of spreading these germs to patients. Treatment Antibiotics Treatment decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis but generally include antibiotics. Antimicrobial resistance Unfortunately, many B. cepacia complex germs are resistant to antibiotics, which makes them difficult to treat.

It spreads through tick bites, primarily by blacklegged (deer) ticks. Some people show no symptoms, others have flu-like symptoms. Babesiosis is preventable and treatable. Overview Babesiosis is a disease caused by microscopic parasites that infect red blood cells. A parasite is an organism (living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. Although there are many different species (types) of Babesia parasite found in animals, only a few infect people. The most common species to infect people in the United States is Babesia microti . Signs and symptoms Many people with Babesiosis do not feel sick and have no symptoms. However, some people might get flu-like symptoms, such as: Fever Chills Sweats Headache Body aches Loss of appetite Nausea Fatigue Since the parasites attack red blood cells, babesiosis can lead to hemolytic anemia. Hemolytic anemia occurs when your red blood cells are destroyed faster than they can be replaced. Babesiosis can become a serious, even life-threatening illness for certain people, especially those who: Do not have a spleen Have a weak immune system for other reasons such as cancer, lymphoma, or HIV Have serious health issues such as liver or kidney disease Are older (> 50 years old) Symptoms, if they appear, may start around a week after infection, but usually develop over a few weeks or months, or longer. How it spreads In the U.S. most Babesia infections are from blacklegged or deer tick ( Ixodes scapularis ) bites. Ticks are typically found in wooded, brushy, or grassy areas. Currently, most babesiosis cases occur in the Northeast and upper Midwest. Other less common ways of getting infected with Babesia include: Getting a blood transfusion that has the parasite in it.

The bacteria that causes anthrax occurs naturally in soil worldwide. People usually get anthrax from infected animals or contaminated animal products. Call a healthcare provider immediately if you think you have been exposed to anthrax. Overview Anthrax is a serious disease usually caused by Bacillus anthracis bacteria. The bacteria are found naturally in soil around the world and commonly affect livestock and wild animals. People usually get sick with anthrax if they come in contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products. People can breathe in anthrax spores, eat food or drink water contaminated with spores, or get spores in a cut or scrape in the skin. Livestock and wild animals can become infected when they breathe in, eat, or drink spores in contaminated soil, plants, or water. These animals can include cattle, sheep, goats, antelope, and deer. Anthrax is rare in the United States. However, occasional outbreaks do happen in wild and domestic grazing animals such as cattle or deer. In the United States, veterinarians recommend yearly vaccination of livestock in areas where animals have had anthrax in the past. Types The type of illness a person develops depends on how anthrax enters the body: through the skin, lungs, or gastrointestinal system. All types of anthrax can cause death if they're not treated with antibiotics. Cutaneous anthrax Cutaneous anthrax happens when anthrax spores get into a cut or scape on the skin when a person handles infected animals or contaminated animal products like wool, hides, or hair. It mostly shows up on the head, neck, forearms, and hands. It's the most common form of anthrax infection, and it's also considered to be the least dangerous.

It's the deadliest form of the disease. People who work in places such as wool mills, slaughterhouses, and tanneries may breathe in the spores when working with infected animals or contaminated animal products. Inhalation anthrax starts primarily in the lymph nodes in the chest before spreading throughout the rest of the body. View Larger Download Inhalation anthrax happens when people breathe in spores. Gastrointestinal anthrax This type of anthrax can happen when a person eats raw or undercooked meat from an infected animal. It has rarely been reported in the United States. It affects the upper gastrointestinal tract (throat and esophagus), stomach, and intestines, causing a wide variety of symptoms. View Larger Download Gastrointestinal anthrax occurs when a person consumes raw or undercooked meat from an infected animal. Injection anthrax Injection anthrax recently was identified in heroin-injecting drug users in northern Europe, but it hasn't been reported in the United States. Injection anthrax is similar to cutaneous anthrax and causes infection deep under the skin or in the muscle where the drug was injected. Did you know? Welder's anthrax is a newly identified and rare disease that has been found in several people who are welders or metalworkers. This disease causes severe pneumonia and can be fatal. If you are a welder or metalworker and you develop fever and chills with sudden cough, chest pain, difficulty breathing, or coughing up blood, see a healthcare provider immediately. About welder's anthrax Symptoms The symptoms of anthrax depend on the type of infection. Symptoms show up anywhere from one day to more than two months after you're exposed to the bacteria that cause anthrax. If you don't get proper treatment, all types of anthrax have the potential to spread through your body and cause severe illness and death. Cutaneous anthrax Cutaneous anthrax shows up as telltale black sores of anthrax infection. Symptoms include: Group of itchy, small blisters or bumps Large amount of swelling around the sore Painless sore commonly on the face, neck, arms, or hand that has a black center Sore appears after the bumps have gone down For injection anthrax, infected sores (abscesses) deep under the skin or muscle at the injection site Inhalation anthrax You can see extensive lung damage in the chest x-ray taken in a 46-year-old man 4 months after anthrax started. Symptoms include: Fever and chills Heavy sweats Chest pain, cough, or shortness of breath Confusion or dizziness Nausea, vomiting, or stomach pains Headache or body aches Extreme tiredness Gastrointestinal anthrax Symptoms include: Fever and chills Swelling of neck or neck glands Sore throat, hoarseness, and pain when swallowing Nausea and vomiting, especially bloody vomiting Diarrhea or bloody diarrhea Headache Red face and red eyes Stomach pain and swelling Fainting Risk factors Most people will never be exposed to anthrax.

The ameba can get into your body through a wound, or if you breathe it in. Balamuthia can cause rare but serious illnesses, including a brain disease that is nearly always fatal. Overview Balamuthia lives in water, soil, and dust. It has been found in many places around the world. The ameba can infect your skin, brain, and other organs. It can cause a deadly brain infection called granulomatous amebic encephalitis (GAE). Balamuthia amebas can cause a rare but deadly brain infection. Early diagnosis and treatment may improve chances of survival. Signs and symptoms Symptoms of a Balamuthia infection can begin with a wound on your skin that doesn’t heal quickly. Symptoms of GAE can appear mild at first and include fever, headache, or confusion. They can become more severe over weeks or months and include difficulty walking and speaking. Keep Reading Signs and Symptoms of Balamuthia How it spreads Balamuthia can infect anyone at any time of the year. You can become infected if water or soil containing the ameba gets into a wound. You also can become infected breathing in dust containing Balamuthia . There are no reports of a Balamuthia infection spreading from person to person except in very rare situations during organ transplantation. Keep Reading What Causes Balamuthia Reducing risk At this time, we don't know how to prevent Balamuthia infections. We also don't know why some people get infected while others don't. CDC continues to track Balamuthia infections so we can learn more about them and how to prevent them. Diagnosis Doctors and scientists use special tests to identify Balamuthia infections.

Symptoms can include diarrhea and abdominal pain. You can get balantidiasis by consuming food or water contaminated with infective feces. Overview Balantidium coli is an intestinal protozoan parasite that causes the infection called balantidiasis. While this type of infection is uncommon in the United States, humans and other mammals can become infected with Balantidium coli by ingesting infective cysts from food and water that is contaminated by feces. Mostly asymptomatic, Balantidium infection can cause such symptoms as diarrhea and abdominal pain. Balantidium coli infection in humans is rare in the United States. Balantidium coli is found throughout the world, but it is most prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions and developing countries. Because pigs are an animal reservoir, human infections occur more frequently in areas where pigs are raised, especially if good hygiene is not practiced. Signs and symptoms Most people infected with Balantidium coli experience no symptoms. Balantidium coli infects the large intestine in humans and produces infective microscopic cysts that are passed in the feces, potentially leading to re-infection or infection of others. People compromised immune systems are the most likely to experience more severe signs and symptoms. These include persistent diarrhea, dysentery, abdominal pain, weight loss, nausea, and vomiting. If left untreated, perforation of the colon can occur. How it spreads Balantidium coli is transmitted through the fecal-oral route. Humans can become infected by eating and drinking contaminated food and water that has come into contact with infective animal or human fecal matter. Infection can occur in several ways, including the following examples: Eating meat, fruits, and vegetables that have been contaminated by an infected person or contaminated by fecal matter from an infected animal, Drinking and washing food with contaminated water, or Having poor hygiene habits.

In their current form, bat influenza viruses do not appear to pose a threat to human health. The bat species currently known to carry bat influenza viruses are not native to the continental United States, but they are common in Central and South America. Causes and public health implications Experts from CDC and Universidad del Valle (University of the Valley) discovered influenza A in bats during a 2009-2010 study in Guatemala. They first found influenza A in bats in little yellow-shouldered bats. 1 Yellow-shouldered bat found in Guatemala. Photo credit: CDC/OID/NCEZID – Amy T. Gilbert. Bat influenza viruses have since been detected in some other species of bats in Central and South America. 2 The discovery of bat influenza viruses is important for public health because bats represent a new animal species that may act as a source of influenza viruses. Influenza viruses are already known to spread and cause disease in other animals. Laboratory research conducted at CDC and elsewhere suggests that bat influenza viruses would need to change significantly to be able to infect and spread easily among humans. Risk of bat flu spreading to humans CDC laboratory research suggests bat influenza viruses would need to undergo significant changes to become capable of infecting and spreading easily among people. Therefore, these viruses do not appear to pose a risk to human health in their current form. However, CDC scientists cannot rule out the possibility that these viruses could eventually become capable of infecting humans. The internal genes of bat influenza viruses are compatible with human influenza viruses. That means it is possible that these viruses could exchange genetic information with human influenza viruses through a process called \"reassortment.\" Reassortment occurs when two or more influenza viruses infect a single host cell, which allows the viruses to swap genetic information.

       " 'could exchange genetic information with human influenza viruses through a process called \"reassortment.\" Reassortment occurs when two or more influenza viruses infect a single host cell, which allows the viruses to swap genetic information. Reassortment facts\\u200e Reassortment can sometimes lead to the emergence of new flu viruses capable of infecting humans. The conditions needed for reassortment between human influenza viruses and bat influenza viruses remain unknown. A different animal (such as pigs, horses, dogs, or seals) would need to serve as a \"bridge.\" That means that another animal would need to be capable of being infected with both bat influenza virus and human influenza viruses for reassortment to occur. Since the discovery of bat flu, there has been at least one study to assess the possibility of reassortment events occurring between bat influenza and other influenza viruses. 3 So far, the results of these studies continue to indicate that bat influenza viruses are very unlikely to reassort with other influenza viruses. Preliminary laboratory research at CDC suggests that human cells do not support growth of bat influenza viruses. 1 Difference between bat influenza viruses and other influenza viruses The bat influenza viruses discovered in Central and South America are very different from other influenza viruses in humans and animals. All influenza A viruses have hemagglutinin (HA) surface proteins. Until the discovery of bat influenza viruses, there were only 16 different classes (or “subtypes”) of HA proteins known to exist in nature. The new bat influenza viruses found in Central and South America are distinct from pre-existing subtypes. CDC scientists have classified them as new subtypes, denoted as “H17” and “H18.” 1 2 The other surface protein-coding gene of bat influenza viruses, neuraminidase (NA), is different from that of known influenza viruses, as well. CDC scientists have proposed new designations for the NA subtypes found in bats: “N10” and “N11.” Learn more about influenza viruses\\u200e For more information on influenza virus biology and pictures of flu viruses, see Influenza (Flu) Viruses and images of Influenza Viruses. Impact on influenza virus evolution The discovery of bat flu has shed light on the evolution of influenza A, B, and C viruses. It is possible that many of the internal genes of bat influenza viruses are descendants of influenza virus families that once circulated more widely in previous centuries and that are now extinct, or yet to be discovered. Using a process called phylogenic analysis, comparisons between different bat influenza viruses found in Central and South America have shown that there is considerable genetic diversity between them. Some researchers concluded that in Central and South American bat populations, the bat influenza viruses may have as much genetic diversity as those found in the influenza viruses of all other mammal and bird species combined. These conclusions suggest that bat influenza viruses have been evolving in bats over a very long time, potentially centuries. 2 How bat flu was discovered The discovery of the bat influenza viruses was made possible by field work conducted by the',\n",

CDC\\'s Rabies program. Universidad del Valle in Guatemala. A total of 316 healthy bats from 21 different species were captured from eight locations in southern Guatemala during 2009 and 2010. Rectal swabs and tissues were collected from each of the bats. Videos showing how specimens are collected from bats in Guatemala are available: \"Global Disease Detectives\" and \"CDC Global Disease Detectives: Clues From a Bat Cave.\" Swabs that were negative for rabies were analyzed by the Pathogen Discovery Program in CDC\\'s Division of Viral Diseases to detect other pathogenic viruses. Initial viral screening determined that 3 of the 316 bats tested positive for influenza. All were from a single species known as little yellow-shouldered bats. The Pathogen Discovery Program was able to identify and sequence the complete genome of the new viruses using high-throughput sequencing instruments in the laboratory.

You can get raccoon roundworm when you consume infectious eggs, usually accidentally. Infections in people are rare, but the parasite can infect other animals, like dogs. Overview Baylisascaris infection is caused by a roundworm found in raccoons. This roundworm can infect people as well as a variety of other animals, including dogs. Human infections are rare but can be severe if the parasites invade the eye (ocular larva migrans), organs (visceral larva migrans) or the brain (neural larva migrans). Species Different species of Baylisascaris are associated with different animal hosts. For example, Baylisascaris procyonis is found in raccoons, and Baylisascaris columnaris is found in skunks. Cases of Baylisascaris infection in people are not frequently reported but can be severe. Baylisascaris procyonis is thought to pose the greatest risk to people because of the often-close association of raccoons to human dwellings. Symptoms The incubation period (time from exposure to symptoms) is usually 1 – 4 weeks. If present, signs and symptoms can include Nausea Tiredness Liver enlargement Loss of coordination Lack of attention to people and surroundings Loss of muscle control Blindness Coma Causes and spread People become infected by consuming infectious eggs. Most infections are in children and others who are more likely to put dirt or animal waste in their mouth by mistake. Prevention Eggs passed in raccoon feces are not immediately infectious. In the environment, eggs take 2 – 4 weeks to become infectious. If raccoons have set up a den or a latrine (places where raccoons defecate) in your yard, raccoon feces and material contaminated with raccoon feces should be removed carefully and burned, buried, or sent to a landfill. Care should be taken to avoid contaminating hands and clothes. Treat decks, patios, and other surfaces with boiling water or a propane flame-gun (exercise proper precautions). Prompt removal and destruction of raccoon feces before the eggs become infectious will reduce risk for exposure and possible infection. Do not keep, feed, or adopt wild animals, including raccoons, as pets.\",\n",

Prompt removal and destruction of raccoon feces before the eggs become infectious will reduce risk for exposure and possible infection. Do not keep, feed, or adopt wild animals, including raccoons, as pets. Washing your hands after working or playing outdoors is good practice for preventing a number of diseases. Diagnosis You should discuss your concerns with your healthcare provider, who will examine you and ask you questions (for example, about your interactions with raccoons or other wild animals). Baylisascaris infection is difficult to diagnosis in humans. There are no widely available tests, so the diagnosis is often made by ruling out other diseases. Treatment A healthcare provider can discuss treatment options with you. No drug has been found to be completely effective against raccoon roundworm in people. Albendazole, a broad spectrum anthelmintic, has been recommended for specific cases. Early treatment might reduce serious damage caused by the infection. If you suspect you may have ingested raccoon feces, seek immediate medical attention.

Bites can cause itching, loss of sleep, and, rarely, allergic reactions. Prevent bed bugs by regularly looking for signs of infestation. More Information For Everyone Health Care Providers Overview Bed bugs ( Cimex species ) are small, flat insects. Bed bugs bite people and animals at night while they sleep, feeding on their blood. Bed bugs are reddish-brown in color, are wingless, and range from 1mm to 7mm in size (roughly the size of Lincoln's head on a penny). They can live several months without a blood meal. Bed bugs are not known to spread diseases to people. However, they cause irritation, itching, and loss off sleep. Removal from dwellings can be expensive and inconvenient to remove. Where you can find bed bugs You can find bed bugs anywhere, from North and South America, to Africa, Asia, and Europe. Bed bugs are in five-star hotels and resorts. How clean a place is does not determine whether bed bugs are present. Signs and symptoms Although bed bugs are not known to spread diseases to people, they can cause itching and loss of sleep. Sometimes intense itching can lead to excessive scratching and possibly a secondary skin infection. An allergic reaction to several bites is possible. If you think you are having an allergic reaction to bed bug bites, speak with your healthcare provider. How to tell if you've been bitten Bed bug bites affect each person differently. Signs of a bed bug bites include No physical signs Small bite marks Serious allergic reactions (rare). When bed bugs bite, they inject fluids (anesthetic and anticoagulant) that prevents a person from feeling the bite when it happens. Most people do not notice the bite marks until they appear from one to several days after the initial bite. Bites look similar to mosquito or flea bites—a slightly swollen and red area that may itch and be irritating. The bite marks may be random or appear in a straight line. Other symptoms of bed bug bites include insomnia, anxiety, and skin problems that arise from intense scratching of the bites. Allergic reactions are possible Allergic symptoms can include enlarged\",\n",

Other symptoms of bed bug bites include insomnia, anxiety, and skin problems that arise from intense scratching of the bites. Allergic reactions are possible Allergic symptoms can include enlarged bite marks, painful swellings at the bite site, and, on rare occasions, anaphylaxis. If you think you are having an allergic reaction to bed bug bites, speak with your healthcare provider. Exposure risks Everyone is at risk for getting bed bugs when visiting an infested area. However, you are at higher risk of getting bed bugs if you travel frequently and share living and sleeping space where other people have previously slept. Causes and spread Bed bugs are experts at hiding. Their slim flat bodies allow them to fit into very small spaces. They can go long periods of time without a blood meal. Bed bugs spread by getting into the seams and folds of luggage, overnight bags, folded clothes, bedding, furniture, and anywhere else they can hide. Most people do not realize they are transporting bed bugs and infecting areas as they travel. Resource\\u200e DPDx - Bed Bug life cycle Reducing risk Early detection and eradication of bed bugs can make infestations easier to control. For those that travel, it may be helpful to look for signs of infestation, such as exoskeletons or bed bugs in folds of mattresses and sheets, in sleeping areas. Where to look for bed bugs Bed bug infestations usually happen around or near areas where people sleep. This includes apartments, shelters, houses, hotels, cruise ships, buses, trains, and dorm rooms. The bugs hide during the day in places on or around the bed. They can hide in The seams of mattresses Box springs Bed frames and headboards Dresser tables Inside cracks or crevices Behind wallpaper Bed bugs can travel over 100 feet in a night but tend to live within 8 feet of where people sleep. Signs of an infestation One of the easiest ways to identify a bed bug infestation is by bite marks on the face, neck, arms, hands, or any other body parts after sleeping. However, these bite marks may take as long as 14 days to develop in some people. It's important to look for other clues to determine if you have an infestation. Look for Exoskeletons (shed after molting), Bed bugs in the fold of mattresses and sheets, Rusty–colored blood spots on mattresses or nearby furniture, and A sweet musty odor. Treatment Treating bites Bed bug bites can cause inflammatory reactions in some people, but usually do not require medical treatment. The best way to treat a bite is to apply antiseptic creams or lotions to help with itching and to avoid scratching the area (to prevent secondary infections). For people with itchy inflammatory reactions, an antihistamine may help control the itching.

Signs and symptoms of benzene poisoning depend on how you were exposed. Get clean and get medical care if you were exposed. Background Benzene is a liquid chemical at room temperature. It either has no color or is light-yellow. It has a sweet smell and is very flammable. Benzene evaporates into the air very quickly. It is heavier than air and may sink into lower areas. Benzene dissolves only a little in water and will float on top of water. Where it is found Benzene is formed in nature and from human activities. Natural sources include volcanoes and forest fires. It is also a natural part of crude oil, gasoline, and cigarette smoke. Benzene is used often in the United States. It is in the top 20 produced chemicals by quantity. Some industries use benzene to make other chemicals that are used to make plastics, resins, and nylon and synthetic fibers. It is also used to make: Detergents Drugs Dyes Some types of lubricants Pesticides Rubbers How it works Benzene works by causing cells not to work correctly. For example, it can cause bone marrow not to produce enough red blood cells. This can lead to anemia. It can also hurt the immune system by changing blood levels of antibodies and causing the loss of white blood cells. Signs and symptoms The level of benzene poisoning depends on the amount, how someone was exposed, and for how long. It also depends on the person's age and medical conditions they may have. These signs and symptoms may show up within minutes to several hours. Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to benzene. If breathed in: Drowsiness and dizziness Fast or irregular heartbeat Headaches Tremors Confusion Unconsciousness Death (at very high levels) If swallowed: Vomiting or irritation of the stomach Dizziness Sleepiness Convulsions (uncontrolled muscle shaking) Fast or irregular heartbeat Death (at very high\",\n",

If breathed in: Drowsiness and dizziness Fast or irregular heartbeat Headaches Tremors Confusion Unconsciousness Death (at very high levels) If swallowed: Vomiting or irritation of the stomach Dizziness Sleepiness Convulsions (uncontrolled muscle shaking) Fast or irregular heartbeat Death (at very high levels) If a person vomits because they ate or drank something with benzene, the vomit could be sucked into the lungs. This can cause breathing problems and coughing. If benzene touches the eyes, skin, or lungs, it can cause injury and irritation. Exposure People working in jobs that make or use benzene may be exposed to the highest levels of it. Outdoors Low levels of benzene can be found at: Tobacco smoke Gas stations Car exhaust Industrial emissions The air around hazardous waste sites or gas stations can contain higher levels of benzene than in other areas. Benzene leaks from underground storage tanks or from hazardous waste sites containing benzene can contaminate well water. Indoors Indoor air generally contains levels of benzene higher than those in outdoor air. It can come from products such as: Glues Paints Furniture wax Detergents What to do if you are exposed Get fresh air by leaving the area where the benzene is. Moving to an area with fresh air is a good way to reduce the possibility of death from benzene. If benzene was released outside, move away from the area. If benzene was released indoors, get out of the building. If you're in immediate danger\\u200e If you swallowed benzene, do not induce vomiting or drink fluids. Get medical attention right away. If you think you were exposed, take your clothes off, wash your body, and get medical care as quickly as possible. Take off your clothes Remove the clothing as quickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of pulling it over the head. If you are helping others, do not touch unsafe areas. Wash your body Wash any benzene from your skin with lots of soap and water. Washing with soap and water will protect you from any chemicals on your body. If your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes. If you wear contacts, remove them and put them with the dirty clothing. Do not put the contacts back in your eyes (even if they are not disposable contacts). If you wear eyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. You can put your eyeglasses back on after you wash them. Throw your clothes away After you have washed yourself, place your clothing inside a plastic bag. Do not touch unsafe areas of the clothing. If you have to touch unsafe areas, or you aren't sure where the unsafe areas are, wear rubber gloves. You can also use tongs, tool handles, sticks, or similar objects to put the clothing in the bag. Anything that touches the dirty clothing should also be placed in the bag. If you wear contacts, put them\",\n",

Throwing away your clothes this way helps protect you and others from any chemicals that might be on your clothes. When the local or state health department or emergency team arrive, tell them what you did with your clothes. The health department or emergency team will arrange for further disposal. Do not handle the plastic bags yourself. For more information about cleaning your body and throwing away your clothes after a chemical exposure, visit \" About Getting Clean .\" Evacuate or \"shelter in place\" If you are near a benzene release, emergency teams may tell you to evacuate the area or \"shelter in place\" inside. For more information on evacuation during a chemical emergency, visit \" Responding to Evacuation .\" For more information on sheltering in place during a chemical emergency, visit \" Responding to Sheltering in Place .\" Treatment The most important thing is for people to seek medical treatment as soon as possible . No cure exists for benzene poisoning. Benzene poisoning is treated with supportive medical care in a hospital. Long-term health effects Blood Long-term exposure, or exposure of a year or more, to benzene can affect the blood. Benzene causes harmful effects on bone marrow and can cause a decrease in red blood cells, leading to anemia. It can also cause excessive bleeding and affect the immune system, increasing the chance for infection. Bones Studies in animals show low birth weights, bones being formed late, and bone marrow damage when pregnant animals breathed benzene. Cancer The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has said that benzene causes cancer in humans. Long-term exposure to high levels of benzene in the air can cause leukemia, a blood-related cancer. Fertility Some women who breathed high levels of benzene for many months had irregular menstrual periods. Some women also had a decrease in the size of their ovaries.

The main cause of the pneumoconioses is workplace exposure. All forms of pneumoconioses can be severe. Overview Healthy lung versus black lung. The primary pneumoconioses are: Abestosis – caused by inhaling asbestos fibers Silicosis – caused by inhaling silica dust Coal workers\\' pneumoconiosis (commonly referred to as CWP or black lung ) caused by inhaling coal mine dust There is also a form called mixed-dust pneumoconiosis. Byssinosis, caused by exposure to cotton dust, is sometimes included with pneumoconioses. Although the pattern of lung abnormality in Byssinosis is different from the types of disease listed above. Also, many consider the term pneumoconosis as referring only to diseases caused by inhaling mineral dusts. Pneumoconiosis typically takes years to develop. However, rapidly progressive forms of silicosis can occur after short periods of intense exposure. When severe, the diseases often lead to lung impairment, disability, and premature death. Pneumoconioses can be avoided through appropriate dust control. Other forms of pneumoconiosis can be caused by inhaling dusts containing: Aluminum Antimony Barium Graphite Iron Kaolin Mica Talc Symptoms Pneumoconiosis symptoms depend on how severe the disease is. They include: Shortness of breath Coughing Increased phlegm Diagnosis Identifying and classifying pneumoconioses Lung x-ray showing pneumoconiosis in coal miner. The pneumoconioses are typically detected through radiological imaging. Severity of lung impairment can be assessed using pulmonary function tests. The International Labor Office (ILO) provides guidelines for classifying radiographs of the pneumoconioses. NIOSH operates the B Reader Program . This program allows physicians to document their proficiency in classifying radiographs (using ILO guidelines) by taking an examination. Treatment Pneumoconiosis cannot be cured. Controlling symptoms through proper treatment is vital. Workers should avoid exposure to dust and smoking . Treatment may include oxygen or medications that help to open lung passages. Workers should see a doctor if they have symptoms they suspect are related to their workplace.

Blood in the urine is the most common symptom. Overview Cancer is a disease in which cells in the body grow out of control. When cancer starts in the bladder, it is called bladder cancer. The bladder (sometimes called the urinary bladder) is a balloon-shaped organ in your lower abdomen, near the pelvis. It stores urine from the kidneys until it is passed out of the body.

Other risk factors include: Having a family history of bladder cancer. Having certain gene mutations (unusual changes made when your body's cells are dividing). Being exposed to too much of certain workplace chemicals used in processing paint, dye, metal, and petroleum products. Taking some kinds of chemotherapy drugs. Drinking well water contaminated with arsenic. Taking the Chinese herb Aristolochia fangchi. Having chronic urinary tract infections (including those caused by Schistosoma haematobium ).

It can remain in your intestines for weeks, months, or years. If you are infected with Blastocystis, it is called blastocystosis. Overview Blastocystis is a microscopic parasite found throughout the world. A parasite is an organism (living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. A full understanding of Blastocystis and whether it causes disease in humans is unclear. There are prescription drugs available to treat blastocystosis in people with symptoms. Signs and symptoms Many people with blastocystosis have no symptoms. However, some people who have Blastocystis in their stool (poop) have some of the following symptoms: Watery or loose stools Diarrhea Abdominal pain Anal itching Weight loss Constipation Excess gas In some studies, blastocystosis has also been associated with various skin rashes and hives. How it spreads It is unclear how Blastocystis spreads. However, the number of people infected appears to increase in areas that use unimproved sanitation facilities (when there is no sanitary separation of human waste from human contact). Studies have suggested that risk of infection may increase through: Consuming contaminated food or water. Working at or attending a daycare or childcare facility. Close contact with a wide range of animals. There is little risk of spreading the infection if you practice good personal hygiene, as outlined in the prevention steps. Prevention You can take steps to prevent blastocystosis. Sanitation and hygiene precautions Use sanitation facilities (toilets and latrines) that are out of reach from animals and will not let feces seep into the water or around food supplies. Wash your hands with soap and warm water after touching or working with soil or animals and before handling food. Teach children the importance of handwashing. Food precautions Wash and peel fruits and vegetables before eating them. Avoid water or food that may be contaminated. When traveling in countries where the water supply may be unsafe, Avoid drinking unboiled tap water. Avoid uncooked foods washed with unboiled tap water. Bottled or canned carbonated beverages, seltzers, pasteurized fruit drinks, and steaming hot coffee and tea are safe to drink.

Most patients do not experience side effects from transfusions. On rare occasions, transfusions can cause adverse reactions in patients receiving blood. Although the U.S. blood supply is safer than ever, some bacteria, viruses, etc. can infect blood transfusion recipients. All blood donors and blood donations are screened for infections and diseases. Overview The U.S. blood supply is safer than it has ever been. However, blood transfusions can transmit any bloodborne pathogen. Report a Possible Outbreak \\u200e To report a possible transfusion-transmitted infection cluster or outbreak. Call: 770-488-7100 E-mail: haioutbreak@cdc.gov Complications Several types of bacteria, viruses, parasites and prions can infect blood donors and recipients, though these infections are rare. Adverse reactions (e.g., allergic reaction, transfusion-transmitted infection, etc.) to a blood transfusion are also very rare. The most common adverse reactions from blood transfusions are allergic and febrile reactions, which make up over half of all adverse reactions reported. Reducing Risk Screening donated blood Healthcare providers and blood banks ask donors a set of standard questions before donating blood including: Whether or not they are in good health Their social behavior and health history If they are free of any bacterial, viral or parasitic diseases If they have traveled to areas where transmittable diseases are common If their answers indicate they are not well or are at risk for having a disease transmissible by blood transfusion, they cannot donate blood. Testing donated blood Once donated, laboratory technicians test for blood type, certain infectious diseases and additional proteins (or antibodies) that may cause adverse reactions in a person receiving a blood transfusion. Keep Reading: Clinical Testing Guidance for Blood Safety Quick Facts There are approximately 7 million blood donors and more than 14 million units of blood transfused annually in the United States. Every 2 seconds someone in the United States needs blood and or platelets. The U.S. healthcare system needs approximately 29,000 units of red blood cells every day.

Body lice spread by direct contact with others who have them. Symptoms include itching, rash, and bites. The only treatment is to improve hygiene and access to clean clothes. Overview Body lice are parasites, or insects, that feed on human blood. Body lice can spread disease. They live and lay eggs on clothing and bedding used by infested people. Adult body lice are small, only 2.3 – 3.6 mm in length (about the size of a sesame seed). Improved hygiene and access to regular changes of clean clothes is the only treatment needed for body lice infestations; however, in some cases pediculicides are recommended. Body lice can spread disease ( epidemic typhus , Bartonella quintana infection , and epidemic relapsing fever ). Symptoms Intense itching (pruritus) and rash caused by an allergic reaction to louse bites are common symptoms of body lice infestation. As with other lice infestations, intense itching leads to scratching which can cause sores and secondary bacterial infection of the skin. When body lice infestation lasts long, heavily bitten areas of the skin can become thickened and darkened, particularly in the mid-section of the body (waist, groin, upper thighs). Who is at risk Body lice exist worldwide but usually affect people who live in crowded conditions. They affect people without access to regular bathing and clean clothes. They can spread quickly in: People experiencing homelessness Refugees Survivors of war or natural disasters How it spreads Body lice spread through direct contact with a person who has body lice. They can also spread through contact with clothing, beds, or linens that have been in contact with a person infested with lice. However, in the United States, actual infestation with body lice tends to occur only in people who do not have access to housing, regular bathing, or clean clothes. Nits (lice eggs) take 6 – 9 days to hatch. Nits are tiny (0.8 – 0.3 mm) and hard to see; they can be confused for dandruff. Nymphs (newly hatched lice) are about the size of a pinhead and take about a week to grow\",\n",
       " \"regular bathing, or clean clothes. Nits (lice eggs) take 6 – 9 days to hatch. Nits are tiny (0.8 – 0.3 mm) and hard to see; they can be confused for dandruff. Nymphs (newly hatched lice) are about the size of a pinhead and take about a week to grow into adults. Adult lice are about the size of a sesame seed, have six legs, and are tan to grayish white. Adult females can lay up to eight nits per day. Adult lice need to feed on blood several times each day; without blood meals, the louse will die within 1 – 2 days off the host. Dogs, cats, and other pets do not spread human lice. Prevention Take these steps to help prevent and control the spread of body lice: Bathe regularly and change into machine-washed clothes at least once a week. Machine wash and dry infested clothing and bedding using the hot water (at least 130°F) laundry cycle and the high heat drying cycle. Dry clean clothing and items that are not washable OR seal them in a plastic bag and store for two weeks. Do not share clothing, beds, bedding, or towels used by a person infested with body lice. You can fumigate or dust with chemical insecticides to control and prevent the spread of body lice for certain diseases (e.g., epidemic typhus). Diagnosis You can diagnose body lice infestation by finding eggs and crawling lice in the seams of clothing. Sometimes you can see a body louse crawling or feeding on the skin. Although body lice and nits can be large enough to see with the naked eye, a magnifying lens may help to find crawling lice or eggs. See a healthcare provider if you are unsure about an infestation. Treatment and recovery You can treat a body lice infestation by improving personal hygiene. Bathe and change into clean clothes at least once a week. Wash clothing, bedding, and towels used by the person infested with lice using hot water (at least 130°F) and machine dry using the hot cycle. Pediculicide, a medicine that can kill lice, is sometimes used for treatment. If prescribed a pediculicide, apply it exactly as directed on the bottle or by your healthcare provider. However, a pediculicide is generally not necessary if hygiene is maintained and items are machine washed appropriately at least once a week.

By 2000, as HIV quickly spread in Southern Africa, the partnership evolved to tackle this devastating epidemic, leading to remarkable results. Today, Botswana stands as a leader in global HIV efforts, having surpassed the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets: 95 percent of people living with HIV in Botswana know their status, 98 percent of people who know their status receive treatment, and 98 percent of people on treatment are virally suppressed. Botswana has made remarkable progress in protecting its next generation, becoming the first country to earn the prestigious “gold tier” certification for eliminating mother-to-child HIV transmission. With support from the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the CDC partnership with Botswana continues to sustain these achievements for future generations, demonstrating what is possible when nations work together.

Check the label on your bottled water for water quality information. If you think you got sick from bottled water, contact your health department to report your illness. Overview Source Bottled water can come from a variety of sources, such as public tap water systems or from under the ground (for example, mineral water). No matter its source, bottled water must meet safe drinking water standards. Safety rules The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates the safety of bottled water in the United States. FDA bases its bottled water standards on the safe drinking water rules for tap water . FDA requires bottled water companies to: Protect bottled water sources from germs and chemicals Test water before and after it is bottled Follow additional safety rules during processing, bottling, holding, and transport Health risks Bottled water contaminated with harmful germs or chemicals can make you sick. Symptoms depend on the type of germ or chemical in the unsafe water and can be mild to serious. Anyone can get sick from unsafe water, but some people are at higher risk.

It is caused by a toxin that attacks the body’s nerves and causes difficulty breathing, muscle paralysis, and even death. The toxin is made by Clostridium botulinum and related bacteria. There are five main kinds of botulism. All are medical emergencies. Overview Current Infant Botulism Outbreak Learn about a current outbreak of infant botulism linked to infant formula. Botulism (\"BOT-choo-liz-um\") is a rare but serious illness caused by a toxin that attacks the body\\'s nerves. Botulism causes difficulty breathing, muscle paralysis, and even death. The toxin is made by Clostridium botulinum and sometimes Clostridium butyricum and Clostridium baratii bacteria (germs). These bacteria can produce the toxin in food, wounds, and the intestines of infants. The bacteria that make botulinum toxin are found naturally in many places, but it\\'s rare for them to make people sick. These bacteria make spores, which act like protective coatings. Spores help the bacteria survive in the environment, even in extreme conditions. The spores usually do not cause people to become sick, even when they\\'re eaten. But under certain conditions, these spores can grow and make one of the most lethal toxins known. The conditions in which the spores can grow and make toxin are: Low-oxygen or no oxygen (anaerobic) environment Low acid Low sugar Low salt A certain temperature range A certain amount of water For example, improperly home-canned, preserved, or fermented foods can provide the right conditions for spores to grow and make botulinum toxin. When people eat these foods, they can become seriously ill, or even die, if they don\\'t get proper medical treatment quickly. Most common types There are 5 main kinds of botulism. Foodborne botulism Foodborne botulism can happen by eating foods that have been contaminated with botulinum toxin. Common sources of foodborne botulism are homemade foods',\n",
       " \"they can become seriously ill, or even die, if they don't get proper medical treatment quickly. Most common types There are 5 main kinds of botulism. Foodborne botulism Foodborne botulism can happen by eating foods that have been contaminated with botulinum toxin. Common sources of foodborne botulism are homemade foods that have been improperly canned, preserved, or fermented. Though uncommon, store-bought foods also can be contaminated with botulinum toxin. Wound botulism Wound botulism can happen if the spores get into a wound and make a toxin. People who inject illicit drugs have a greater chance of getting wound botulism. People who have had a traumatic injury, such as a motorcycle crash, or surgery also can get wound botulism. Infant botulism For reasons we do not understand, some infants get botulism when the spores get into their intestines, grow, and produce the toxin. Iatrogenic botulism Iatrogenic botulism can happen if too much botulinum toxin is injected for cosmetic reasons, such as for wrinkles. It also can happen if too much of the toxin is injected for medical reasons, such as for migraine headaches. Adult intestinal toxemia Adult intestinal toxemia is also known as adult intestinal colonization. This kind of botulism is a very rare. It can happen if the spores of the bacteria get into an adult's intestines, grow, and produce the toxin (similar to infant botulism). We don't know why people get this kind of botulism. People with a serious health condition affecting the gut might be more likely to get ill. All kinds of botulism can be fatal and are medical emergencies. If you or your child has signs and symptoms of botulism , immediately see your doctor or go to the emergency room. Do not wait.

BSE caused a major outbreak in the 1980-90s, with cases reported in at least 24 countries. Most cases occurred in the United Kingdom, but many other countries also reported cases. Changes to feed policies have made BSE extremely rare. Animal health officials continue to monitor suspicious deaths in cows to watch for a potential BSE recurrence. Causes and risk BSE is caused by a prion, an infectious protein. Prions are misfolded forms of proteins normally found in the bodies of animals and people. It typically takes years for symptoms to begin after an animal is infected with a prion. Scientists believe BSE may have been caused by feeding cattle meat-and-bone meal that contained prion-infected products from cows or sheep. There is strong evidence the BSE outbreak grew and spread throughout the U.K. when such infected feed was given to young calves. Outbreaks The United Kingdom The first two cases of BSE were identified in cows in 1986 in the United Kingdom. The cows were likely infected in the 1970s. The U.K. quickly became the epicenter of the outbreak. Overall, more than 184,000 cows in the U.K. died from BSE between 1986 and 2015. The outbreak was widespread, with more than 35,000 U.K. herds affected. Cases peaked in 1993 at nearly 1,000 new cases per week. Cases deceased drastically after control measures were implemented. BSE cases are still reported occasionally but are very rare. North America The first North American BSE case was reported in 1993 in a cow imported into Canada from the UK. Rendered cohorts of this cow may have been responsible for 19 additional Canadian BSE cases beginning in 2003. In addition, animal health officials have identified 6 BSE cases in cows in the United States. One was imported from Canada and is believed to have been infected there. The others were diagnosed with atypical BSE, which many researchers believe to be a sporadic illness not caused by contaminated feed.

Other countries Outside the U.K., BSE was first reported in Ireland in 1989 and Portugal and Switzerland in 1990. By 2005, the number of countries reporting BSE among native cattle increased to 24, with the majority in Europe. Control measures Animal health officials eventually determined BSE-infected cows had eaten feed made from other cows that died from prion disease. This led to feed bans in multiple countries, which drastically reduced the number of BSE cases reported. Early efforts to control the BSE outbreak focused on culling (killing) sick animals to prevent them from entering the food chain. The UK implemented the most stringent control measure - excluding animals >30 months old from the human and animal food supplies. It also included a ban on using meat from around the animals' spinal columns since prions affect the nervous system. The programs - along with bans in other countries - have prevented additional BSE outbreaks. Occasional cases still occur, but they are very rare. Risk to people Strong evidence exists that consuming meat from BSE-infected cows causes variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in people. vCJD cases began in the U.K. about 10 years after BSE-contaminated beef likely made its way for an extended period into food produced for people. This is consistent with the time between when someone is exposed to a prion disease and when they develop one themselves. As BSE has been largely eradicated, it is not thought to pose much risk to people currently.

The UK implemented the most stringent control measure - excluding animals >30 months old from the human and animal food supplies. It also included a ban on using meat from around the animals' spinal columns since prions affect the nervous system. The programs - along with bans in other countries - have prevented additional BSE outbreaks. Occasional cases still occur, but they are very rare. Risk to people Strong evidence exists that consuming meat from BSE-infected cows causes variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in people. vCJD cases began in the U.K. about 10 years after BSE-contaminated beef likely made its way for an extended period into food produced for people. This is consistent with the time between when someone is exposed to a prion disease and when they develop one themselves. As BSE has been largely eradicated, it is not thought to pose much risk to people currently.

It is often called the \"brain-eating ameba\" because it can infect the brain and destroy brain tissue. Brain infections caused by Naegleria fowleri are very rare but nearly always fatal. Overview Naegleria fowleri lives in soil and warm freshwater lakes, rivers, ponds, and hot springs around the world. In very rare cases, Naegleria fowleri has been found in poorly maintained swimming pools, splash pads, and other recreational venues. The ameba also has been found in tap water. If water containing the ameba goes up the nose and to the brain, it can cause an infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). Typically, fewer than 10 people a year in the United States get PAM. Nearly everyone who gets PAM dies from it. Between 1962 and 2024, there were 167 reported cases of PAM in the United States. Only four have survived. Naegleria fowleri infects people by traveling up the nose and to the brain (shown here) where it consumes brain tissue. Photo: Dr. James Roberts, Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta Signs and symptoms Early symptoms of PAM can include headache, fever, nausea, and vomiting. PAM progresses rapidly. Most people with PAM die within 1 to 18 days after symptoms begin. It usually leads to coma and death after 5 days. As PAM progresses, symptoms can include stiff neck, confusion, lack of attention to people and surroundings, loss of balance, and hallucinations.

A few infections have occurred when people used tap water that contained Naegleria fowleri to rinse their sinuses or cleanse their nasal passages. In very rare instances, people have become infected from recreational water like splash pads and a surf park that did not have enough chlorine. You cannot get a Naegleria fowleri infection from swallowing water containing the ameba. You also can't get an infection from someone else or pass it on to others. Keep Reading What Causes Naegleria fowleri Infection Reducing risk To help protect yourself against a Naegleria fowleri infection: Hold your nose or wear a nose clip if you are jumping or diving into fresh water. Always keep your head above water in hot springs. Don't dig in shallow water because the ameba is more likely to live there. Use distilled or boiled tap water when rinsing your sinuses or cleansing your nasal passages. Keep Reading How to Prevent Naegleria fowleri Infection When Rinsing Sinuses or Nasal Passages Diagnosis A Naegleria fowleri infection is diagnosed using laboratory tests. These tests are available in only a few labs in the United States, including CDC. Because these infections are so rare and hard to detect, diagnosis sometimes happens after a person has died. Contact a healthcare provider immediately if you or a loved one is experiencing symptoms of PAM. Treatment and recovery Naegleria fowleri can cause PAM which destroys brain tissue and causes the brain to swell. Unfortunately, more than 97% of people with PAM have died from the infection. PAM progresses very quickly. This has made treatments for the disease difficult to identify. There is some evidence that certain drugs may be effective. For Health Care Providers Clinical Care of Naegleria fowleri Infection What CDC is doing CDC's Free-Living and Intestinal Amebas Lab is one of only a few labs in the country that can identify Naegleria fowleri. It is experienced in diagnosing Naegleria fowleri infections and can provide results quickly. Keep Reading About CDC's Naegleria fowleri Program Free-living amebas A free-living ameba is a kind of one-celled organism that lives in water and soil around the world. Most people will come into contact with these amebas during their lives but won't get sick. Others will develop rare but serious infections. Although there are several types of free-living amebas that live in the environment, three are known to cause severe disease in people: Acanthamoeba Balamuthia mandrillaris Naegleria fowleri All of these amebas can cause life-threatening brain infections. Some can also cause infections of the eyes, skin, sinuses, and other parts of the body.

Doctors use a mammogram to look for early signs of breast cancer. Regular mammograms can find breast cancer early, sometimes up to 3 years before it can be felt. How a mammogram is done You will stand in front of a special x-ray machine. A technologist will place your breast on a plastic plate. Another plate will firmly press your breast from above. The plates will flatten the breast, holding it still while the x-ray is being taken. You will feel some pressure. The steps are repeated to make a side view of the breast. The other breast will be x-rayed in the same way. You will then wait while the technologist checks the x-rays to make sure the pictures do not need to be redone. Keep in mind that the technologist cannot tell you the results of your mammogram. Each woman's mammogram may look a little different because all breasts are a little different. A doctor with special training, called a radiologist, will look at the x-ray for early signs of breast cancer or other problems. What a mammogram feels like Having a mammogram is uncomfortable for most women. Some women find it painful. A mammogram takes only a few moments, though, and the discomfort is over soon. What you feel depends on the skill of the technologist, the size of your breasts, and how much they need to be pressed. Your breasts may be more sensitive if you are about to get or have your period.

Your breasts may be more sensitive if you are about to get or have your period. Tips for getting a mammogram Try not to have your mammogram the week before you get your period or during your period. Your breasts may be tender or swollen then. On the day of your mammogram, don't wear deodorant, perfume, or powder. These products can show up as white spots on the X-ray. Some women prefer to wear a top with a skirt or pants, instead of a dress. You will need to undress from your waist up for the mammogram. Are you worried about the cost?\\u200e\\u200e \\u200eCDC offers free or low-cost mammograms through the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program. Find out if you qualify. About the results When will I get the results of my mammogram? You will usually get the results within a few weeks, although it depends on the facility. A radiologist reads your mammogram and then reports the results to you and your doctor. If there is a concern, you will hear from the mammography facility earlier. Contact your health care provider or the mammography facility if you do not receive a report of your results within 30 days. What happens if my mammogram is normal? Continue to get mammograms according to recommended time intervals. Mammograms work best when they can be compared with previous ones. This allows the radiologist to compare them to look for changes in your breasts. What happens if my mammogram is abnormal? An abnormal mammogram does not always mean that there is cancer. But you may need to have additional mammograms, tests, or exams before the doctor can tell for sure. You may also be referred to a breast specialist or a surgeon. It does not necessarily mean you have cancer or need surgery. These doctors are experts in diagnosing breast problems. Doctors will do follow-up tests to diagnose breast cancer or to find that there is no cancer. View Larger An example of a normal mammogram. Each woman’s mammogram may look a little different because all breasts are a little different. Who can I talk to if I have questions? If you have a regular doctor, talk to him or her.

Breastfeeding can reduce the risk of certain health conditions for both infants and mothers. About 1 in 4 infants is exclusively breastfed as recommended until they are 6 months old. CDC supports and promotes breastfeeding across the United States. Breastfeeding benefits babies and mothers Infants who are breastfed have reduced risk of: Asthma. Severe lower respiratory disease. Obesity. Type 1 diabetes. Acute otitis media (ear infections). Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Gastrointestinal infections, which can cause diarrhea and vomiting. Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) (death of intestinal tissue) for preterm infants. Breastfeeding can help lower a mother's risk for: High blood pressure. Type 2 diabetes. Ovarian cancer. Breast cancer. Support for breastfeeding Breastfeeding is the clinical gold standard for infant feeding and nutrition. We must do more to create supportive and safe environments for mothers who choose to breastfeed. —Dr. Ruth Petersen, director of CDC's Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity What CDC is doing We work with state and local organizations to improve continuity of care in breastfeeding . Quality, consistent care over time includes hospital initiatives, worksite accommodation, and community support initiatives. We also collect data to track progress. We promote best practices in health care settings by: Supporting the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding , a global standard to promote breastfeeding in hospitals. Encouraging obstetricians, pediatricians, and nurses to educate new mothers about breastfeeding. We support mothers at work and in their communities by: Partnering with states to help employers support breastfeeding mothers with: Places to pump and store breast milk. Flexible work hours.

Breastfeeding statistics About 1 in 4 infants are exclusively breastfed as recommended by the time they are 6 months old. Low rates of breastfeeding add more than $3 billion a year to U.S. medical costs for the mother and child. Three-quarters (78%) of Black infants are ever breastfed, which is below the national average of 86%. Milestones In the United States: The percentage of babies who start out breastfeeding increased from 73% in 2004 to 86% in 2022. The percentage of births in hospitals with recommended maternity care practices that support breastfeeding increased from 3.8% in 2010 to 28.9% in 2021.

Signs and symptoms of bromine poisoning depend on how you were exposed. Get clean and get medical care if you were exposed. Background Bromine is a naturally occurring element that is a liquid at room temperature. It has a brownish-red color and smells like bleach. It dissolves in water. Where it is found Bromine is found naturally in the earth's crust and in seawater. Bromine can also be found as another option to chlorine in swimming pools. Products with bromine are used in agriculture, sanitation and as fire retardants (chemicals that help prevent things from catching fire). Some bromine-containing products were historically used as sedatives (drugs that can make people calm or sleepy). However, these drugs are for the most part no longer found on the market in the United States. How it works Bromine can irritate the skin and tissues, including the tissues that make mucus in your mouth and nose. Signs and symptoms The level of bromine poisoning depends on the amount, how someone was exposed, and for how long. It also depends on the person's age and medical conditions they may have. Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to bromine. If breathed in: Cough Trouble breathing Headache Irritation of your mucous membranes (inside your mouth, nose, etc.) Dizziness Watery eyes If exposed to skin: Skin irritation and burns Cooling sensation closely followed by a burning feeling If swallowed in large amounts: Nausea Vomiting Swallowing compounds (combinations of bromine with other chemicals) with bromine causes different effects depending on the compound. Exposure You can be exposed by: Drinking water with bromine in it Eating food with bromine in it Breathing in bromine gas Touching bromine gas or liquid Bromine gas is heavier than air, so it would settle in low-lying areas.

What to do if you are exposed First, get fresh air by leaving the area where the bromine was released. Moving to an area with fresh air is a good way to reduce the chances of negative health effects from bromine. If the bromine was released outdoors, move away from the area where the bromine was released. Go to the highest ground possible, because bromine is heavier than air and will sink to lower areas. If bromine was released indoors, get out of the building. When immediate care is needed\\u200e If you swallowed bromine, do not force vomiting or drink fluids. Get medical attention right away. Dial 911 and explain what has happened. If you think you were exposed, take your clothes off, wash your body, and get medical care as quickly as possible. Take off your clothes Remove the clothing as quickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of pulling it over the head. If you are helping others, avoid touching unsafe areas. Wash your body Wash any bromine from your skin with lots of soap and water. Washing with soap and water will protect you from any chemicals on your body. If your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes. If you wear contacts, remove them and put them with the dirty clothing. Do not put the contacts back in your eyes (even if they are not disposable contacts). If you wear eyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. You can put your eyeglasses back on after you wash them. Throw your clothes away After you have washed yourself, place your clothing inside a plastic bag. Avoid touching unsafe areas of the clothing. If you can\\'t avoid touching unsafe areas, or you aren\\'t sure where the unsafe areas are, wear rubber gloves. You can also use tongs, tool handles, sticks, or similar objects to put the clothing in the bag. Anything that touches the dirty clothing should also be placed in the bag. If you wear contacts, put them in the plastic bag, too. Tie the bag, and then put that bag inside another plastic bag. Throwing away your clothes this way helps protect you and others from any chemicals that might be on your clothes. When the local or state health department or emergency team arrive, tell them what you did with your clothes. The health department or emergency team will arrange for further disposal. Do not handle the plastic bags yourself.

No specific cure exists for bromine poisoning. Bromine poisoning is treated with supportive medical care in a hospital. Supportive medical care can include providing medicine, oxygen, and intravenous fluids (fluids given through a needle into your vein). Long-term health effects Survivors of serious poisoning caused by breathing in bromine may have long-term lung problems. Survivors may also have long-term effects from systemic poisoning (poisoning that affects the whole body instead of a specific spot). An example of a long-term effect is kidney or brain damage from low blood pressure.

Signs and symptoms depend on how much you were exposed to, how you were exposed, and for how long. If you were exposed, get clean and get medical care. Background Riot control agents (also called \"tear gas\") are chemical compounds that temporarily make people unable to function. It does this by causing irritation to the eyes, mouth, throat, lungs, and skin. Several different compounds are riot control agents: Chloroacetophenone (CN) Chlorobenzylidenemalononitrile (CS) Chloropicrin (PS) - also used as a fumigant Bromobenzylcyanide (CA) Dibenzoxazepine (CR) Combinations of various agents. Where it is found Riot control agents are used by law enforcement officials for crowd control. It is also used by individuals and the general public for personal protection (for example, pepper spray). CS is also used in military settings to test the speed and ability of military personnel to use their gas masks. How it works Riot control agents work by causing irritation to the area of contact (for example, eyes, skin, nose) within seconds of exposure. The effects usually only last 15 to 30 minutes after the person is away from the source and cleaned off. Signs and symptoms The level of poisoning depends on the amount someone was exposed to, how the person was exposed, and for how long. It also depends on the location of exposure (indoors versus outdoors). People exposed to riot control agents may experience some or all of the following symptoms immediately after exposure: Eyes: excessive tearing, burning, blurred vision, redness Nose: runny nose, burning, swelling Mouth: burning, irritation, difficulty swallowing, drooling Lungs: chest tightness, coughing, choking sensation, noisy breathing (wheezing), shortness of breath Skin: burns, rash Other: nausea and vomiting Long lasting exposure or exposure to a large dose may cause severe effects such as: Blindness Glaucoma - a serious eye condition that can lead to blindess Immediate death due to',\n",

Exposure Riot control agents such as CN and CS are liquids or solids (for example, powders). Therefore, they could be released in the air as fine droplets or particles. If agents are released into the air, people could be exposed through skin contact, eye contact, or breathing them in. What to do if you are exposed Since breathing in riot control agents is the primary way of exposure, leave the area and get fresh air. Quickly moving to an area where fresh air is available is highly effective in reducing exposure to riot control agents. If the riot control agents were released outdoors, move away from the area where the agents were released. Stay away from dense, low-lying clouds of riot control agent vapor. Go to the highest ground possible. Riot control agents will form a dense vapor cloud that can travel close to the ground. If the riot control agents were released indoors, get out of the building. Evacuate or \"shelter in place\" If you are near a release, emergency teams may tell you to evacuate the area or \" shelter in place \" inside. If you think you were exposed\\u200e Take your clothes off, wash your body, and get medical care as quickly as possible. Dial 911 and explain what has happened.

Keep Reading: About Getting Clean Treatment Treatment involves helping the affected person get more oxygen in his or her blood and stopping chemical burns from getting worse. Medications that are used to treat asthma (such as bronchodilators and steroids) may also be used to help the person breathe. Treating eye exposures involves rinsing the eyes with water until there is no sign of riot control agents in the eyes. Burn injuries to the skin are treated with standard burn management techniques, including use of medicated bandages. No antidote exists for poisoning from riot control agents. Long-term health effects Long-lasting exposure or exposure to a large amount of riot control agent may cause severe effects such as the following: Glaucoma (a serious eye condition that can lead to blindness) Eye scarring Cataracts Breathing problems, such as asthma These effects are more likely if someone was expsoed in a closed setting, such as indoors. If symptoms go away soon after a person is no longer exposed, long-term health effects are unlikely to happen.

The disease spreads to people through contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products. People in certain jobs or settings that work with animals or animal products may face increased exposure to the bacteria that cause brucellosis. Brucellosis can be treated with antibiotics. Overview Brucellosis is an infectious disease caused by a family of bacteria called Brucella . You can get the disease when you come in contact with infected animals or animal products contaminated with the bacteria. Animals that most commonly get brucellosis include cats, dogs, sheep, cattle, goats, pigs, bison, elk, caribou, moose, and wild hogs, among others. People can get brucellosis by: Eating undercooked meat such as sheep, cow, goat, or camel. Eating undercooked game meat such as bison, elk, caribou, moose, and wild hog. Consuming unpasteurized (raw) milk or other dairy products made from contaminated milk. Breathing in the bacteria that cause brucellosis. Getting body fluids from infected animals in the eyes, nose, or mouth. Preparing meat or hides after hunting. Getting certain animal vaccines in the eyes, nose or mouth or accidentally injecting yourself when vaccinating animals Working in a lab with brucellosis samples. People with certain jobs or hobbies may face increased exposure to the bacteria that cause brucellosis, including: Slaughterhouse workers Hunters Veterinarians and veterinary staff Animal breeders or animal shelter staff Laboratory workers It is extremely rare for brucellosis to spread between people. Signs and symptoms doctors examining a patient If you think you've been exposed to brucellosis, contact your health care provider. Brucellosis can cause a range of signs and symptoms in people, and some can occur for a long time before it's diagnosed. The first symptoms can include: Fever Sweating Generally feeling badly (malaise) Not wanting to eat (anorexia) Headache Pain in muscles, joint, and/or back Feeling more tired than usual (fatigue) Other symptoms may continue or may come and go until you've had treatment, including: Fevers that keep coming back Arthritis Swelling of the testicles and scrotum area Infection of the heart (endocarditis) Memory loss, confusion, and irritability Depression Swelling of\",\n",

If you are not sure whether a dairy product is pasteurized, don't eat or drink it. Hunters and those who work with animals People who work with animal tissues and body fluids, including animal caretakers ( veterinarians , vet techs, shelter staff, etc.), hunters, butchers, and animal herdsman, are at higher risk of brucellosis infection. If you work with animal tissues, protect yourself by wearing: Rubber gloves Goggles Gowns or aprons Masks or respirators View Larger Protect yourself while working with animal tissues If the animal is infected, this protective clothing will help keep the bacteria that causes brucellosis from getting into your eyes or inside a cut or wound on your skin. Laboratory personnel Brucellosis is the most commonly reported laboratory-associated bacterial infection. If you work in a lab , take precautions when handling samples to prevent infection. If you are exposed, determine your risk and follow recommendations for symptom monitoring and possible post-exposure prophylaxis or treatment. Treatment and recovery Once your healthcare provider has confirmed that you have brucellosis from test results, you can begin treatment with antibiotics. Your doctor will decide which antibiotics you'll get for a minimum of 6-8 weeks. To be sure you get the right medicines for you, let your healthcare providers know if you are: Pregnant Allergic to doxycycline or rifampin Are immunosuppressed from medical conditions or other medicines Brucella RB51 treatment If you have with an infection from a strain of Brucella called RB51 from consuming infected animal products, you'll need antibiotics other than rifampin. This particular strain of Brucella is resistant to it, meaning rifampin will not treat the infection. It's important that you take all your medicines when being treated for brucellosis. If you're not properly treated, the infection can become chronic and lead to long-term disease associated with arthritis, endocarditis, chronic fatigue, depression, and swelling of the liver or spleen. Depending on the timing of treatment and how sick you are, recovery may take a few weeks to several months. Death from brucellosis is rare and only happens in less than 2% of cases.

Bullying is widespread in the United States and causes harm to youth. Preventing bullying involves teaching kids safe ways to stand up against it and enhancing their interpersonal skills, like empathy and conflict management. What is bullying? CDC defines bullying as any unwanted aggressive behavior(s) by another youth or group of youths, who are not siblings or current dating partners. It involves an observed or perceived power imbalance, and is repeated multiple times or is highly likely to be repeated. Bullying may inflict harm or distress on the victim including physical, psychological, social, or educational harm. 1 Common types of bullying include: Physical such as hitting, kicking, and tripping. Verbal including name-calling and teasing. Relational or social such as spreading rumors and leaving out of the group. Damage to victim\\'s property. Bullying can also occur through technology, called electronic bullying or cyberbullying. 1 A young person can be a perpetrator, a victim, or both (also known as a \"bully/victim\"). Quick facts and stats Bullying is an adverse childhood experience that is widespread in the United States. Bullying harms all youth involved including those who are bullied, those who bully others, and bystanders who witness it. Bullying is common. About one in five high school students reported being bullied on school property in the past year. More than one in six high school students reported being bullied electronically in the past year including through texting and social media. 2 Some youth experience bullying more than others. Female students were more likely than male students to experience bullying, both on school property and electronically. Additionally, Asian students and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander students were less likely than Hispanic, White, and Multiracial students to be bullied at school. Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander students were less likely than students from most other racial and ethnic groups to be electronically bullied. 2 Bullying is',\n",
       " \"Asian students and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander students were less likely than Hispanic, White, and Multiracial students to be bullied at school. Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander students were less likely than students from most other racial and ethnic groups to be electronically bullied. 2 Bullying is a frequent discipline problem. A national survey found that 28% of middle schools, 15% of high schools, and 10% of elementary schools reported the occurrence of bullying at school at least once a week. About 37% of middle schools reported the occurrence of cyberbullying at least once a week, followed by 25% of high schools and 6% of elementary schools. 3 Warning signs Not all children who are bullied show warning signs, but StopBullying.gov suggests being aware of these common signs: Unexplained injuries. Lost or destroyed clothing, books, electronics, or jewelry. Frequent headaches or stomachaches, feeling sick, or faking illness. Difficulty sleeping or frequent nightmares. Declining grades, loss of interest in schoolwork, or not wanting to go to school. Outcomes Bullying can result in physical injury, social and emotional distress, self-harm, and even death. It also increases the risk for depression, anxiety, sleep difficulties, lower academic achievement, and dropping out of school. Youth who bully others are at increased risk for substance misuse, academic problems, and experiencing violence later in adolescence and adulthood. 4 Youth who bully others and are bullied themselves suffer the most serious consequences and are at greater risk for mental health and behavioral problems. Prevention We all have a role to play in preventing bullying. Youth and adults play important roles in preventing violence and creating safe communities where young people can thrive. A bystander (someone who witnesses bullying, either in person or online) can make a positive impact by becoming an upstander. An upstander is someone who sees what happens and intervenes, interrupts, or speaks up to stop the bullying. Learn more about becoming an upstander and take action against bullying. Parents, school staff, and other caring adults can: Help kids understand bullying and how to stand up to it safely. Keep the lines of communication open by checking in with kids often and listening to them. Encourage kids to do what they love so they can build confidence and make friends. Model how to treat others with kindness and respect. See Also Stopbullying.gov: How to prevent bullying Additionally, school-based programs that strengthen youths' interpersonal and emotional skills, including empathy, conflict management, and teamwork, can reduce bullying.

Good infection control practices, including around the use of water, can help reduce infection risk. B. cepacia germs can be resistant to antibiotics, making them difficult to treat. What it is Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) is a group of bacteria commonly found in soil and water. Symptoms Symptoms vary, ranging from no symptoms to serious respiratory infections, especially in patients with cystic fibrosis or other chronic lung disease. Other symptoms may include: Fever Fatigue At-risk populations In the United States, people in healthcare settings and those with weakened immune systems or chronic lung diseases, particularly cystic fibrosis, are at highest risk of infection with B. cepacia complex. B. cepacia complex poses little medical risk to healthy people. How it spreads Exposure from water, soil or aqueous (watery) environments. Contact with contaminated surfaces. Contact with contaminated equipment. Person-to-person transmission, more commonly in patients with cystic fibrosis. Reducing risk Patients and caregivers Keep their hands clean , particularly before and after caring for wounds or touching a medical device. Ask others to clean their hands before touching the patient or handling medical devices. Avoid exposing wounds and indwelling medical devices (devices put in or connected to the patient's body) to nonsterile water. Allow healthcare staff to clean their room daily when in a healthcare setting. Healthcare providers Healthcare providers should always follow recommended infection control practices to reduce the risk of spreading these germs to patients. Treatment Antibiotics Treatment decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis but generally include antibiotics.

Melioidosis is spread through contact with contaminated soil, air, or water. Cases may increase after hurricanes, heavy rain, and other severe weather events. The disease is often confused for other conditions, making diagnosis difficult. Melioidosis is treated with antibiotics. Overview Melioidosis is caused by bacteria called Burkholderia pseudomallei, or B. pseudomallei. It's spread to people and animals through direct contact with soil, water, or air contaminated by the bacteria. Cases may increase after hurricanes, heavy rain, and other severe weather events because the bacteria rise to the surface of the soil. People can get melioidosis by: Breathing in contaminated dust or water droplets Eating or drinking contaminated food or water Having contact with contaminated soil or water, especially through skin breaks (cuts, scrapes, etc.) or getting it in their mouths It's very rare for people to get the disease from another person. Many kinds of animals can get melioidosis, including: Sheep Goats Pigs, hogs, boar Horses Cats Dogs Cows B. pseudomallei is mostly found in tropical climates, especially in Southeast Asia and northern Australia, where it causes widespread melioidosis. In the United States, B. pseudomallei is found in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Gulf Coast area of the state of Mississippi. Most melioidosis illnesses in the United States occur in people who have traveled to areas where the disease is more common. Some cases have also occurred in people who have had contact with contaminated products from overseas. Signs and symptoms Melioidosis has a wide range of signs and symptoms. You usually develop symptoms of melioidosis within 1 to 3 weeks after you've been infected with the bacteria. Some cases have developed symptoms months or years after exposure. The disease can affect one body system or affect the entire body. Because of these factors, melioidosis is hard to diagnose and may be mistaken for other diseases.\",\n",
       " \"within 1 to 3 weeks after you've been infected with the bacteria. Some cases have developed symptoms months or years after exposure. The disease can affect one body system or affect the entire body. Because of these factors, melioidosis is hard to diagnose and may be mistaken for other diseases. Sometimes the illness is just in one area (localized), and it may look like an ulcer or skin sore. You might have a fever, swelling, and muscle aches. Most often, melioidosis shows up as a lung infection. You might have a cough, chest pain, high fever, headache, and you might not feel like eating. Whether you've just come down with melioidosis or you've had it for a long time, it can affect different organ systems throughout the body (disseminated infection). It can cause problems with the liver, spleen, prostate, joints, bones, lymph nodes, skin, or brain. Melioidosis can lead to a dangerous bloodstream infection (sepsis). Symptoms of infection include: Fever Headache Trouble breathing Stomach or chest pain Muscle pain Confusion Seizure Risk factors Although healthy people may get melioidosis, having the following medical conditions may increase your risk: Diabetes Heavy alcohol use Liver disease Kidney disease Thalassemia (a blood disorder) Cancer, or another condition that weakens the immune system Chronic lung disease, like cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or bronchiectasis Certain activities also may increase your risk of being exposed to the bacteria that causes melioidosis, including: Travel to areas where the disease is common. Breathing in contaminated water droplets or soil dust that get into the air after severe weather like hurricanes or heavy rainfall. Hobbies or jobs that could put you in contact with contaminated soil or water. Drinking unchlorinated or untreated drinking water. Reducing risk In areas where the disease is widespread, contact with contaminated soil or water can put people at risk for melioidosis. To help lower the risk of exposure: If you have open skin wounds, or if you have chronic conditions like diabetes or kidney disease, avoid contact with soil and standing water. If you perform agricultural work or have hobbies or jobs that raise your risk of exposure, wear boots, which can prevent infection through your feet and lower legs. Healthcare workers can use standard precautions when treating patients with melioidosis to help prevent infection. They should also label samples appropriately if they suspect melioidosis to protect lab personnel. Laboratory personnel should follow good laboratory practices, including using appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and respiratory protection. Treatment and recovery If you are diagnosed with melioidosis, doctors will decide how long you'll need treatment based on how bad the infection is. Treatment generally includes: Intravenous (in the vein) antibiotics from 2 to 8 weeks, followed by Oral (pills by mouth) antibiotics for 3 to 6 months It's important to complete your treatment so that the infection goes away completely.

       " \"8 weeks, followed by Oral (pills by mouth) antibiotics for 3 to 6 months It's important to complete your treatment so that the infection goes away completely. What CDC is doing One reason public health authorities study the disease is because the bacteria that cause melioidosis might be used as a weapon in a biological attack. A biological attack is the intentional release of pathogens (germs) that can sicken or kill people, livestock, or crops. We don't know if this kind of attack will ever happen. CDC and other federal agencies prepare for biological attacks to protect as many people as possible. Keep Reading Melioidosis and Bioterrorism CDC works with state, tribal, local, and territorial agencies to investigate potential cases of melioidosis . Among other cases, in 2021, CDC linked four cases of melioidosis in patients from Georgia, Kansas, Minnesota, and Texas. A public health investigation eventually linked all cases to a commercially imported product from a melioidosis-endemic country. Recently, CDC and state health officials in Georgia identified four cases of melioidosis that occurred from 1983 through 2024 in the same Georgia county. B. pseudomallei has been found to occur naturally in the Gulf Coast region of the United States. CDC is working with health departments to learn more about how widespread the bacteria is and what impact it's having.

CASPER is quick, relatively inexpensive, flexible, and uses a simple reporting format. It uses a valid sampling methodology to collect information at the household level. About CASPER is a type of rapid needs assessment (RNA) that provides household-level information to public health leaders and emergency managers. CASPER can provide accurate and timely data for decision makers through precise analysis and interpretation. CASPER is a cross-sectional epidemiologic design; it is not surveillance. Information from CASPERs can help public health and emergency managers: Initiate public health action Identify information gaps Facilitate disaster planning, response, and recovery activities Allocate resources Collect and assess new or changing needs in the community Interactive Map of CASPERs See the interactive map for examples of how CASPER has been used throughout the United States since 2001. The CASPER methodology is an adaptation of epidemiologic techniques used by scientists in the World Health Organization's (WHO's) Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) who estimate vaccine coverage in Africa. CASPER's cluster sampling design involves two stages. The first stage includes 30 clusters selected probability proportional to size. The second stage includes seven households interviewed within each cluster. This design provides estimates for the population. There may be situations in which this design is not feasible or ideal. Modifications are acceptable. For additional information, read the CASPER Overview fact sheet . There are many opportunities for CASPERs to influence public health. A CASPER can be used in both a disaster and non-disaster setting. For example, CASPER methodology has been used to do the following: Analyze public health perceptions Estimate needs of a community Assist in planning for emergency response Benefits of CASPER Information is key for decision-making. Information sent to the right people, at the right place, at the right time, is optimal for any successful response. CASPER addresses this by providing valid information rapidly about the general and health needs of a community to decision-makers. CASPER is generalizable (providing population estimates), timely, relatively low cost, reported in a simple format, and flexible. CASPER was\",\n",

CASPER addresses this by providing valid information rapidly about the general and health needs of a community to decision-makers. CASPER is generalizable (providing population estimates), timely, relatively low cost, reported in a simple format, and flexible. CASPER was originally designed to provide information during a disaster response. It can also be used when population-representative data are needed during other disaster phases (preparedness, recovery, mitigation). Additionally, it can be used in situations unrelated to a disaster. For example, public health departments have used CASPER to: Identify household-level information about community health status Learn more about emerging infectious diseases, such as Zika virus and H1N1 Assess community awareness/opinions/concerns on subjects such as the following: Climate change Opioid use Healthy homes Radiation emergency preparedness Goals The primary goals of the CASPER are to rapidly obtain information about the needs of an affected community and to assess changes in needs during the response or recovery period. CASPER also produces household-based population estimates of needs for decision makers. Examples of CASPER objectives include the following: Determine the critical health needs Assess the impact of a disaster on the community Characterize the population residing in the area including any ongoing health effects Evaluate the effectiveness of recovery efforts using a follow-up CASPER CASPER is not intended to deliver food, medicine, medical services or other resources to the affected area or to provide direct services to residents such as cleanup or home repair. CASPER toolkit In the early 2000s, the two-stage cluster method became an increasingly widespread method for disaster response. CDC’s National Center for Environmental Health developed the CASPER Toolkit to outline and standardize the assessment methodology. CDC coined the term CASPER to distinguish it from other rapid needs assessments. The CASPER toolkit provides guidelines to assist personnel from any federal, state, tribal, local, or territorial (STLT) public health department or other emergency response agencies in conducting CASPER. The toolkit is focused on United States disaster response. However, it may also be adapted for use in a non-disaster or international setting. The toolkit provides a standardized, step-by-step guide for conducting a CASPER, including: Preparing a checklist Questionnaire development Sample selection Training Data collection Analysis Report writing Templates and examples Public health personnel, emergency management officials, academics, or others who wish to assess household-level public health needs will find the toolkit useful for rapid data collection for actionable decision-making during disaster or non-emergency situations. Keep Reading: CASPER Field Materials Using CASPER data Data from CASPERs are used for the following: Provide situational awareness Confirm (or contradict) rumors or anecdotal reports Identify and provide estimates of needs in the community, such as food, water, medication Establish priorities Tailor interventions and communication messaging Other potential benefits of CASPER data include the following: Monitor changes in community needs Raise visibility of emergency management and public health in the community Justify requests for outside assistance or funding Evaluate the effectiveness of response activities Serve as field exercise to build',\n",

Keep Reading: Interactive Map Getting started During a disaster, the local, state, or regional emergency managers or health department officers may decide to initiate a CASPER when at least one of the following conditions occurs: The effect of the disaster on the population is unknown The health status and basic needs of those affected are unknown Response and recovery efforts need to be evaluated CASPER methodology can be used in both a disaster and non-disaster setting. CASPERs have been conducted to assess public health perceptions and to estimate needs of a community during a non-disaster setting. Regardless of the setting and objectives, once the decision to conduct the CASPER has been made, it should be initiated as soon as possible. CDC is available for technical assistance for any CASPER, regardless of type (preparedness, response, recovery, non-disaster, etc.). Considerations Prior to conducting a CASPER, consider whether CASPER provides an appropriate sampling methodology based on your: Objectives Timeframe Available resources A clear understanding of how CASPER information will be used, who the relevant partners are, and needed and available resources is important prior to moving forward with your CASPER. Remember, a CASPER will be descriptive of the entire sampling frame (geographic area from which your sample is drawn). It will not provide detailed information on subpopulations or specific groups. For example, if you want to determine the needs or status of pregnant women or persons experiencing homelessness, you should not conduct a CASPER. CASPER phases There are four phases in a CASPER: prepare for the CASPER; conduct the CASPER in the field; analyze the data; and write the report. Phase 1: Prepare for CASPER Checklist to prepare for CASPER. As you prepare to conduct a CASPER, there are many planning questions that should be addressed. Work with leadership, key partners, and CASPER subject matter experts (SMEs) within your state or CDC to help plan and prepare. Keep in mind that preparing for a CASPER can take several hours (e.g., during a response) or, if time allows, several months (e.g., in a non-disaster setting). Keep Reading: Prepare for CASPER Phase 2: Conduct the CASPER in the field Group of volunteers CASPER is conducted through face-to-face interviews in the field. There are several advantages to conducting face-to-face interviews. These include a high response rate and the ability to distribute health information or other materials to the community. Face-to-face interviews have the additional benefit of directly connecting the community to local staff, increasing the visibility of and trust in the health department.

Face-to-face interviews have the additional benefit of directly connecting the community to local staff, increasing the visibility of and trust in the health department. Interview teams can also provide anecdotal information (e.g., direct visual inspection of a disaster-affected area, common concerns overheard in the community not captured in the questionnaire) that can help guide response and recovery efforts, implementation of any recommendations, and future plans. Keep Reading: Conduct the CASPER in the field Phases 3 and 4: Analyze and report CASPER data Analyzing CASPER data Data from the questionnaire can be entered into any statistical software package that allows for multistage sample design weighting. CDC recommends using Epi Info™, which is user-friendly, does not require computer permissions for download, and is available free of charge. Access tutorials and guidance on Epi Info ™. Data from the tracking form can be entered into any spreadsheet such as Microsoft Excel. Disseminating findings is a vital component of a CASPER.

CDC priorities statement As the world's premier public health institute, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is at the front lines of public health threats to Americans, even when those threats emerge overseas. CDC must aim to protect the lives of all Americans, advancing health through science, technology, and innovation. CDC must lead with integrity to prevent and protect from diseases, detect emerging threats, both domestically and internationally, and drive state-of-the-art solutions—empowering communities and strengthening public health systems for a safer, healthier nation. CDC serves the American public—individuals, families, and communities—who rely on accurate data, health guidance, and preventive measures. CDC also serves healthcare providers, researchers, policymakers, businesses, state and local health agencies, and global health partners that rely on CDC for data and guidance to scale improved health outcomes for all Americans at home and abroad. To strengthen public confidence and lead a modern public health system, CDC must be anchored in a set of core values that reflect the evolving needs and expectations of Americans. Public trust in CDC must be restored through transparency and reliance on evidence-based scientific data and analysis. Americans benefit from practical, science-driven steps to protect their health and further expect proactive, fast responses to health risks. America additionally needs a public health system that embraces innovation and a modernized infrastructure. Understanding the fundamental role CDC plays in the public health sphere, the following Priorities Statement illustrates the overall direction of CDC, in furtherance of the goals of the President and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary. The following is not an exhaustive list of CDC priorities but is, instead, a roadmap highlighting goals and priorities, all through the lens of providing Gold-Standard Science, as envisioned in the Make America Healthy Again Commission Report\",\n",

CDC is specifically prioritizing a commitment to: gold-standard science; 1 global leadership; rebuilding trust, transparency, and credibility; rapid, evidence-based responses to crises; vaccine safety and efficacy research; advancing our understanding of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), and chronic disease; modernizing public health infrastructure while enhancing our approach to health data; and otherwise ensuring compliance with the goals and priorities of the Trump Administration and HHS. A commitment to gold-standard science and ensuring trust, transparency, and credibility Public trust in CDC and public health has declined in recent years due to inconsistent messaging, lack of transparency, and challenges in responding appropriately to emerging health threats. Dwindling public trust has undermined CDC\\'s ability to lead effectively during crises and has weakened public adherence to health recommendations. Strengthening and sustaining this trust is essential to CDC\\'s mission, as it enables rapid decision-making, stronger partnerships, and coordinated national responses in times of crisis. More broadly, sustained trust ensures communities engage with prevention efforts, support science-based guidance, and contribute to a healthier, more resilient nation. Credibility is not just about better communication, it is foundational to CDC\\'s long-term impact, effectiveness, and legitimacy. CDC will achieve this trust and credibility by making its leadership more public-facing and accountable to Americans; improving data transparency and ensuring all recommendations are backed by clear, publicly accessible evidence; and establishing processes to ensure integrity in scientific decision-making. As illustrated by the Trump Administration\\'s Executive Order on \"Restoring Gold Standard Science,\" CDC will conduct all science in a manner that is reproducible; transparent; communicative of error and uncertainty; collaborative and interdisciplinary; skeptical of its findings and assumptions; structured for falsifiability of hypotheses; subject to unbiased peer review; accepting of negative results as positive outcomes; and without conflicts of interest. CDC is committed to restoring a gold standard for science to ensure that federally funded research is transparent, rigorous, and impactful, and that all decisions are informed by the most credible, reliable, and impartial scientific evidence available.

       " \"to restoring a gold standard for science to ensure that federally funded research is transparent, rigorous, and impactful, and that all decisions are informed by the most credible, reliable, and impartial scientific evidence available. CDC is committed to restoring Americans' faith in the scientific enterprise and institutions that create and apply scientific knowledge in service of the public good. Employing gold-standard science methodologies will spur innovation, translate discovery to success, and ensure continued American strength and global leadership in technology. A commitment to global leadership CDC's Global Health Center addresses global challenges such as HIV, tuberculosis, vaccine-preventable diseases, and emergency and refugee health. When a viral hemorrhagic fever is identified, such as Ebola, CDC is first to confirm the diagnosis and provide guidance on how to contain the virus within a country and to prevent it from entering the United States. Strategically located in 63 countries around the globe, CDC also serves another 20 countries from these hubs. As a major partner in implementing the PEPFAR program, CDC receives 40% of the resources and implements 60 percent of the program. Across the globe and often with external organizations, CDC is a trusted partner identifying risks early, sending out teams to combat highly infectious disease, training local clinical and public health staff, providing Personal Protective Equipment, vaccine and medicines, and offering advice to Americans abroad as well as supporting international Governments and Ministries of Health leadership and response. As part of an evolving system of response, the Biothreat Radar Detection program seeks out samples from wastewater and international travelers to know real-time when a new infection poses a risk to America. In addition, CDC receives infectious samples from around the globe offering rapid testing and surveillance to prepare for flu at home and guide rapid response for highly infectious diseases where they start and can travel around the globe. Through lessons learned from COVID-19, CDC has advanced its capacities to lead the world in keeping us safe here and abroad. A commitment to ensuring rapid, evidence-based responses to crises Public health emergencies need fast, coordinated, transparent, and evidence-based responses. Delays in data collection, fragmented decision-making, inconsistent guidance, and gaps in risk communication undermine the nation's ability to contain threats and protect lives. Ensuring rapid, science-driven responses is critical to minimizing harm, maintaining public trust, and restoring stability. To meet this goal, CDC must continue to strengthen its emergency response systems by streamlining internal processes, improving risk communication strategies, and ensuring that laboratory capacity is fully equipped and tested—capable of rapidly developing and deploying scalable diagnostics during crises. Embedding structures for real-time learning, independent after-action reviews, and the application of lessons learned will ensure that each crisis response is smarter, faster, and more effective than the last. To meet the challenges of today and anticipate the challenges of tomorrow, CDC must evolve into a high-performing, mission-driven organization that embraces innovation and streamlines operations. Modernizing internal operations will ensure CDC is not only effective in crisis but consistently excellent in execution, delivering faster\",\n",
       " \"more effective than the last. To meet the challenges of today and anticipate the challenges of tomorrow, CDC must evolve into a high-performing, mission-driven organization that embraces innovation and streamlines operations. Modernizing internal operations will ensure CDC is not only effective in crisis but consistently excellent in execution, delivering faster decisions, smarter resource use, and a greater impact for Americans. A commitment to vaccine safety and efficacy research Gold-Standard Science will be applied to all intramural and extramural CDC vaccine safety and efficacy research. CDC will ensure that CDC vaccine efficacy and safety databases and datasets as well as future contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, and the like, for such datasets and databases are available through the least burdensome public use data agreements to restore trust and improve efficacy and safety through transparency and accountability. CDC will also preserve all internal datasets, protocols, programs and adjustments to databases and datasets for public access and reproducibility. A commitment to advancing our understanding of the causes of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), and chronic disease CDC is committed to conducting its own research while also partnering with other federal agencies and outside researchers and institutions to understand the etiology of the ASD and NDD epidemics. CDC will utilize existing and new data resources both within and outside of CDC to better understand factors associated with the increases in ASD, NDD, and chronic diseases that are plaguing our children and adults. CDC data indicates that ASD diagnoses have increased over the past 25 years from 1 in 150 to nearly 1 in 31. A commitment to modernizing public health infrastructure and enhancing our approach to health data Modernizing public health infrastructure is essential to building a faster, smarter, and more cost-effective health system—one that can detect and respond to outbreaks in real time, leverage advanced technologies, and deliver community-driven solutions. By investing in modern tools, integrated data, and state-of-the-art capabilities, CDC can lead a transformation that not only strengthens day-to-day operations but also ensures the nation is prepared for future health emergencies. CDC's traditional data silos are being replaced with robust, integrated data that fosters interdisciplinary research to get faster, more robust results for Americans. Enhancing CDC's (and HHS's) approach to health data must recognize that the states serve as key partners and must be encouraged to maintain robust and up-do-date health data systems. There must be a shared responsibility across federal and state governments, while emphasizing the subsidiarity principle that public health functions should be performed at the lowest effective level of governance (the concept of subsidiarity), with federal structures offering support where scale or specialized expertise is required and as required by statute. Network governance highlights the importance of collaborative, interdependent nodes (state-based service units, federal expertise, and Health Data Utilities (HDUs)) working through shared standards rather than hierarchical command. Systems resilience frames the need for redundancy, adaptability, and transformability, ensuring that CDC can withstand shocks, respond to emerging public health crises, and evolve as public health challenges change. Collectively,\",\n",

Systems resilience frames the need for redundancy, adaptability, and transformability, ensuring that CDC can withstand shocks, respond to emerging public health crises, and evolve as public health challenges change. Collectively, these principles guide a strategy that positions public health as local in action, national in standards, and global in preparedness, while leveraging existing assets such as the Consumer Food Data System (CFDS) and Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) officers and modernizing infrastructure through HDUs. Conflicts of interest The public must know that unbiased science—evaluated through a transparent process and insulated from conflicts of interest—guides the recommendations of our health agencies, and CDC-funded programs and activities carried out by Federal partners. CDC will deprioritize funding for programs that present conflicts of interest or otherwise compromise their objectivity or integrity in carrying out CDC-funded programs. Immigration Consistent with applicable federal law, Federal funds should not be used to encourage or support illegal immigration. Protecting life and the family CDC programs will not use taxpayer funds to fund or promote elective abortions, consistent with the Hyde Amendment. CDC will promote the dignity of human life at all stages of development, improve maternal health care, and strengthen the family. Ending disorder on America\\'s streets CDC grants will prioritize evidence-based programs and deprioritize programs that fail to achieve adequate outcomes, including so-called \"harm reduction\" or \"safe consumption\" efforts that only facilitate illegal drug use and its attendant harm, consistent with SAMHSA guidance issued on July 29, 2025. CDC will deprioritize support for \"housing first\" policies that fail to ensure accountability and fail to promote treatment, recovery, and self-sufficiency. CDC will increase competition among grantees through broadening the applicant pool and hold grantees to higher standards of effectiveness in reducing homelessness and increasing public safety. CDC will ensure that its funds reduce rather than promote homelessness by supporting, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable federal law, comprehensive services for individuals with serious mental illness and substance use disorder, including crisis intervention services. CDC does not support drug injection sites for illegal drugs, or so-called \"safe consumption sites,\" or the use or distribution of illegal drugs and associated paraphernalia. To the extent allowable by applicable federal law, CDC intends to give priority to grantees in States and municipalities that actively meet the below criteria: (i) enforce prohibitions on open illicit drug use; (ii) enforce prohibitions on urban camping and loitering; (iii) enforce prohibitions on urban squatting; (iv) enforce, and where necessary, adopt, standards that address individuals who are a danger to themselves or others and suffer from serious mental illness or substance use disorder, or who are living on the streets and cannot care for themselves, through assisted outpatient treatment or by moving them into treatment centers or other appropriate facilities via civil commitment or other available means, to the maximum extent permitted by law; or (v) substantially implement and comply with, to the extent required, the',\n",
       " \"living on the streets and cannot care for themselves, through assisted outpatient treatment or by moving them into treatment centers or other appropriate facilities via civil commitment or other available means, to the maximum extent permitted by law; or (v) substantially implement and comply with, to the extent required, the registration and notification obligations of the Sex Offender Registry and Notification Act, particularly in the case of registered sex offenders with no fixed address, including by adequately mapping and checking the location of homeless sex offenders. Gender ideology and protecting children CDC believes the health and safety of children must be the highest priority. HHS released a comprehensive review of the evidence and best practices for promoting the health of children and adolescents with gender dysphoria. This review, informed by an evidence-based medicine approach, found medical interventions, such as puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and surgeries, that attempt to transition minors away from their sex are unsupported by the evidence and have an unfavorable risk/benefit profile. Based on that evidence, it is a CDC priority to protect children from these practices, and, to the extent allowable by applicable federal law and any relevant court orders, CDC programs will deprioritize programs that engage in these practices where permissible. CDC funds will also not support the costs of such practices where not required by the law or court order. HHS released guidance promulgating sex-based definitions rooted in biological truth. It is a CDC priority to recognize that a person's sex as either male or female is unchangeable and determined by objective biology, and to ensure CDC programs accurately reflect science, including the biological reality of sex. DEI To the extent permitted by law, CDC will deprioritize diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives that prioritize group identity over individual merit. CDC believes opportunities should be based on character, effort, and ability, not race or other group identity. CDC is committed to restoring merit-based opportunities and removing unlawful discriminatory practices (including unlawful proxies for racial discrimination). CDC has previously invested substantially in ideologically-laden concepts like health equity—mainly on identifying and documenting worse health outcomes for minority populations. This has not translated into measurable improved health for minority populations, and in many cases has undermined core American values. CDC will prioritize efforts that go beyond the use of ideologically laden concepts to focusing on solution-oriented approaches. This includes actively testing, advancing, scaling, and implementing innovative evidence-based interventions and treatments that address poor health outcomes, including the root causes of Americans' chronic disease epidemic. Parental rights CDC believes parents are the primary decision-makers in their children's education and should have full authority over what their children are taught. School policies should include transparency and choice, and curricula should emphasize knowledge, critical thinking, and civic responsibility, without imposing ideas that may conflict with parents' political, religious, or social beliefs. CDC will prioritize funding Federal partners that protect parental rights and provide maximum transparency to parents and the public. CDC will implement these priorities consistent with applicable laws, regulations,\",\n",

COVID-19 vaccines used in the response to the pandemic underwent the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history. Safety monitoring used established systems. CDC provides timely updates on selected adverse events (any side effect or health problem after vaccination that is concerning to you, even if you are not sure if the vaccine caused the event) reported to VAERS after COVID-19 vaccination. Monitoring process After a vaccine is authorized or approved for use, vaccine safety systems monitor adverse events (rare health conditions) and watch for potential safety problems. Keep Reading About CDC’s Vaccine Safety Monitoring Program COVID-19 vaccines have undergone the most extensive safety analysis in U.S. history. The U.S. FDA COVID-19 Vaccines website includes important recommendations for ongoing safety evaluations after any COVID-19 vaccine is made available under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) or receives full FDA approval. Monitoring systems The following system and information sources were developed during the COVID-19 pandemic. They add an additional layer of safety monitoring, giving CDC and FDA the ability to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine safety in real time and make sure COVID-19 vaccines are as safe as possible.

What it is A TBI affects how the brain works Doctor examines a brain using modern technology. A traumatic brain injury, or TBI, is an injury that affects how the brain works. It may be caused by a: Bump, blow, or jolt to the head, or Penetrating injury (such as from a gunshot ) to the head There are three main types of TBI: Mild TBI or concussion Moderate TBI Severe TBI TBI is a major cause of death and disability There were over 69,000 TBI-related deaths in the United States in 2021. 1 That's about 190 TBI-related deaths every day. TBIs affect the lives of people of all ages. Anyone can experience a TBI, but data suggest that some groups are at greater risk of dying from a TBI or experiencing long-term health problems after the injury. 2 Examples of groups who are more likely to be affected by TBI, include: Racial and ethnic minorities 3 Service members and veterans 4 People who experience homelessness 5 People who are in correctional and detention facilities 6 Survivors of intimate partner violence 7 People living in rural areas 8 Learn more about health disparities and TBI .

How TBIs happen People most commonly get TBIs from a fall, firearm-related injury, motor vehicle crash, or an assault. Research shows that: Falls lead to nearly half of the TBI-related hospitalizations. 9 Firearm-related suicide is the most common cause of TBI-related deaths in the United States. 3 10 Motor vehicle crashes and assaults are other common ways a person may get a TBI. 9 For more detailed information on the leading ways people get TBIs and the groups of people most likely to get a TBI, check out CDC's TBI data reports . Populations TBIs may be missed in older adults Older adults are more likely to be hospitalized and die from a TBI compared to all other age groups. 9 Still, TBIs may be missed or misdiagnosed in older adults because symptoms of TBI overlap with other medical conditions that are more common among older adults, such as dementia. Healthcare providers should check for signs and symptoms of TBI if an older adult has: Fallen or has a fall-related injury, such as a hip fracture. Been in a car crash. This is especially important among older adults who are taking blood thinners, 11 such as: Anticoagulants like warfarin (Coumadin), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), and apixaban (Eliquis). Antiplatelet medications like clopidogrel (Plavix), ticagrelor (Brilinta), and acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin). These medicines may increase the risk for bleeding in the brain following a TBI. 11 Bleeding in the brain after a TBI may put a person at risk for more severe injury or death. Potential effects of TBIs A TBI may lead to short- or long-term health problems Depending on the severity of the injury, those who get a TBI may face health problems that last a few days or the rest of their lives. For example, a person with a mild TBI or concussion may experience short-term symptoms and feel better within a couple of weeks or months. And a person with a moderate or severe TBI may have long-term or life-long effects from the injury. A person with a possible TBI should be seen by a healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider may have treatment to help speed your recovery. Most people with a mild TBI or concussion can recover safely at home following a medical check-up. People with a moderate or severe TBI may need ongoing care, such as rehabilitation services, to help with their recovery. A TBI during childhood may affect brain development TBI affects children differently than adults. An injury of any severity to the developing brain may: Disrupt a child's development. Limit their ability to participate in school and other activities, like sports.

The illness is called campylobacteriosis. People most commonly get Campylobacter infection by eating raw or undercooked poultry. Eating other contaminated foods, drinking untreated water, and touching animals that carry Campylobacter can also cause infection. Overview Campylobacter are bacteria that can make people ill with diarrhea. The illness is called campylobacteriosis. Campylobacter cause the most bacterial diarrheal illnesses in the United States. CDC estimates that 1.5 million people in the United States get ill from Campylobacter every year. Fast facts Many Campylobacter infections are not diagnosed or reported. Most infections are not part of recognized outbreaks . Infections are more common in summer than in winter. People at risk Anyone can get Campylobacter infection. But some groups of people are at increased risk for infection or serious illness. These groups include Children younger than 5 Adults 65 and older People with a weakened immune system People who work with animals International travelers How it spreads Campylobacter can spread from animals to people. Campylobacter can live in the intestines, liver, and other organs of animals. Many chickens, cows, and other animals carry Campylobacter without becoming sick. Campylobacter can spread from these animals to people. People can get infected in many ways. It takes very few Campylobacter to make someone sick. For example, a single drop of juice from raw chicken can contain enough Campylobacter to cause an infection. Common ways people get infected include: Eating raw or undercooked poultry or other foods, including seafood, meat, and produce Preparing raw or lightly cooked foods, including salad and fruits, with knives or on cutting boards that were used with raw poultry, seafood, or meat Touching animals or their food, water, poop, belongings (such as toys and bowls), or habitats (such as beds, cages, tanks, coops, stalls, and barns) Drinking untreated water Some outbreaks linked to Campylobacter Outbreaks of Campylobacter infections among people have been linked to many sources.

Not all unusual patterns of cancer are cancer clusters. Contact your state, tribal, local, or territorial health department or cancer registry if you think your community is experiencing more cancer than usual. Overview Cancer is a group of diseases in which some of the body’s cells grow uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body. As a group, cancers are very common. Given the frequency with which cancers are diagnosed, sometimes situations arise where an unusual number of cancers are diagnosed among people in a particular location. These unusual numbers may be from chance, or they may result from the following: Different cancer screening practices Different access to health care, which may reflect other social and economic factors Genetic susceptibility to a particular cancer Behavioral risks and social determinants of health Occupational exposures Environmental exposures Many causes of cancer are unknown. However, some environmental exposures have been shown to be related to the development of cancer in specific organs. For example, if you are exposed to asbestos , you could develop mesothelioma . Definitions Some unusual patterns of cancer are considered a cancer cluster . A cancer cluster is defined as a greater than expected number of the same or etiologically related cancer cases that occurs within a group of people in a geographic area over a defined period of time. Etiology refers to causes and risk factors associated with the development of disease. For example, exposure to the sun can cause skin cancer. The definition of a cancer cluster can be further explained as follows: A greater than expected number When the number of observed cases is greater than typically observed in a similar setting. Of the same or e tiologically related cancer cases Cases are of the same type, are within a family of tumors (for example Ewing's family of tumors ) or have\",\n",
       " \"A greater than expected number When the number of observed cases is greater than typically observed in a similar setting. Of the same or e tiologically related cancer cases Cases are of the same type, are within a family of tumors (for example Ewing's family of tumors ) or have a known or suggested link to the same specific environmental or chemical exposures. It is possible to consider multiple cancer types when such a known exposure (for example, radiation or a specific chemical) is linked to more than one cancer type or when more than one contaminant or exposure type has been identified. Within a group of people The population in which the cancer cases are occurring is defined by its demographic factors (for example, race/ethnicity, age, and sex). In a geographic area The geographic area may be based upon pre-existing geopolitical boundaries (for example, census tract, county, or ZIP code/ZIP code tabulation area). It may be defined according to the nature and extent of potential exposures that may cross multiple or partial boundaries. For example, air pollution from a hazardous waste incinerator which may cross multiple counties or census tracts. These geographic boundaries are used to determine the number of cancer cases as they relate to the total population in this predefined area. It is possible to create or obscure a cluster inadvertently by modifying the area of interest. Over a defined period of time The time frame used to establish the beginning and end dates for analysis. The time period chosen for analysis will affect both the total cases observed and the calculation of the expected incidence of cancer in the population. Keep in mind Not every unusual pattern of cancer will meet the above definition of a cancer cluster. Unusual patterns of cancer that meet some of the criteria described above and also have plausible environmental concerns still warrant further evaluation or assessment by local or state health departments. Reporting cancer concerns If you suspect your community or workplace may be experiencing more cases of cancer than expected, or if you'd like information such as cancer statistics or trends in your area, contact your state, tribal, local, or territorial health department or state/territory cancer registry . A state, tribal, local, or territorial health department provides the first response to reports of unusual patterns of cancer. For information about cancer in the workplace, please see the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health website. Examining unusual patterns of cancer State, tribal, local, and territorial health departments, along with cancer registries, respond to questions about unusual patterns of cancer. Usually, health departments start by gathering information about the unusual pattern of cancer, including the expected cancer rate, types of cancer, number of cases, and the age, sex, race, address, occupation, and age at diagnosis of the people with cancer. CDC/ATSDR has created a decision-making tool that can be used by health departments for determining the need to further assess an unusual pattern of cancer. The tool contains a set\",\n",
       " \"cancer, number of cases, and the age, sex, race, address, occupation, and age at diagnosis of the people with cancer. CDC/ATSDR has created a decision-making tool that can be used by health departments for determining the need to further assess an unusual pattern of cancer. The tool contains a set of criteria that can be used to assess the cancer(s) of concern and/or related environmental risk factors. These criteria promote further assessment of unusual patterns of cancer. Reducing your risk of developing cancer In general, cancers have a variety of risk factors related to behavioral, lifestyle, occupational, and environmental risks. For many cancers, you can reduce your risk of developing cancer by adopting a healthy lifestyle that includes avoiding tobacco use, excessive alcohol consumption, and sun exposure; increasing physical activity; maintaining a recommended body weight; and eating a healthy and nutritious diet. Taking advantage of cancer screening also will reduce your risk. For more information about preventing cancer, visit the following websites CDC's Division of Cancer Prevention and Control The National Institutes of Health's National Cancer Institute American Cancer Society What CDC is doing The federal role in responding to unusual patterns of cancer is limited. As needed, state, tribal, local, or territorial health departments may request technical assistance in response to unusual patterns of cancer from CDC/ATSDR. CDC/ATSDR may provide technical recommendations and make referrals to the appropriate state, tribal, local, or territorial health department or cancer registry. ATSDR is directed by congressional mandate to perform specific functions concerning the effect on public health of hazardous substances in the environment. These functions include the following: Public health assessments of waste sites Health consultations concerning specific hazardous substances Health surveillance and registries Response to emergency releases of hazardous substances Applied research in support of public health assessments Information development and dissemination Education and training concerning hazardous substances Contact your state, tribal, local, or territorial health department or state/territory cancer registry for inquiries regarding unusual patterns of cancer being investigated in your community. More information For more information about cancer in the workplace, visit the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health website. The Guidelines for Examining Unusual Patterns of Cancer and Environmental Concerns provide more information on how unusual patterns of cancer are investigated. Questions?

It is caused by specific type A influenza viruses known to infect, cause illness, and spread in dogs. In general, canine influenza viruses are thought to pose a low threat to people. Signs and symptoms Canine influenza, also known as dog flu, is currently caused by an influenza A(H3N2) virus that spreads in dogs. Dog flu likely poses a low threat to people. Canine influenza A(H3N2) viruses are different from seasonal influenza A(H3N2) viruses that commonly spread among people. To date, there is no evidence of spread of canine influenza viruses from dogs to people. There has not been a single reported case of human infection with a canine influenza virus anywhere in the world. In 2016, CDC used the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool to evaluate the potential risk of canine influenza A(H3N2) viruses causing a pandemic and found it to be low. Evolving viruses Influenza viruses are constantly changing. It is possible that a canine influenza A virus could change to gain the ability to infect and spread easily between people. Humans have little immunity against new, non-human (novel) influenza A viruses. Infections in people with novel influenza A viruses are concerning when they occur. If these viruses acquire the ability to spread easily among people, it could result in a pandemic. For this reason, the World Health Organization conducts global flu surveillance, which has led to detection of novel influenza A virus infections in humans. Surveillance focuses on novel influenza A viruses of animal origin (such as avian or swine influenza A viruses). Signs of Illness in Dogs The signs of this illness in dogs include: cough, runny nose, fever, lethary, eye discharge, and reduced appetite. However, not all dogs will show signs of illness. The severity of illness associated with canine flu in dogs can range from no signs to severe illness resulting in pneumonia and sometimes death. Most dogs recover from dog flu\",\n",
       " \"include: cough, runny nose, fever, lethary, eye discharge, and reduced appetite. However, not all dogs will show signs of illness. The severity of illness associated with canine flu in dogs can range from no signs to severe illness resulting in pneumonia and sometimes death. Most dogs recover from dog flu within 2 to 3 weeks. However, some dogs may develop secondary bacterial infections, which can lead to more severe illness and pneumonia. Anyone who has concerns about their pet's health, or whose pet is showing signs of dog flu, should contact their veterinarian. Testing is available to confirm canine influenza A(H3N2) virus infection in dogs. Your veterinarian can tell you if testing is appropriate. Understanding risk H3N2 canine influenza viruses are not endemic in dogs in the United States but multiple, localized outbreaks with regional die-outs continue to occur, seeded by repeated re-introductions from Asia. H3N8 canine influenza viruses have not been reported since 2016 and do not appear to be actively circulating anymore. If evidence emerges that canine influenza viruses can infect people with the potential for sustained human-to-human spread, CDC has a plan in place. CDC will execute its existing authorities to limit the introduction and/or spread of that pandemic virus into or within the United States. CDC regulations require that dogs be healthy to enter the United States. Dogs may be denied entry or further evaluated if they look like they could be sick with a communicable disease. For dogs that appear sick or are dead upon arrival in the United States, CDC can require a veterinary examination or a necropsy (animal autopsy) at the owner's expense. Multiple agencies may have regulatory authority over pets such as dogs and cats when entering the United States. The United States Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Veterinary Services has animal health requirements related to bringing a pet dog to the United States from a foreign country. How it spreads Almost all dogs are susceptible to dog flu infection. Dog flu tends to spread among dogs housed in kennels and shelters. Dog flu is thought to spread mainly through respiratory droplets produced when infected dogs cough or sneeze. It can also spread through contact with contaminated surfaces. What CDC is doing about dog flu\\u200e Current CDC influenza virus regulations apply only to viruses with pandemic potential in people. However, CDC is doing a number of things to be prepared in the unlikely event that dog flu becomes a threat to humans or to animals other than dogs. CDC continues to conduct year-round surveillance for seasonal and novel influenza A viruses. All human infections with novel influenza A viruses are fully investigated. Human infections with a novel influenza A virus of animal origin are reportable to CDC. CDC has existing collaborative protocols with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Veterinary Services to work together in the event of outbreaks of novel influenza A viruses. These same protocols would be followed in the\",\n",

These same protocols would be followed in the event of an outbreak of dog flu among people. Third, CDC conducted a risk assessment on the pandemic potential of H3N2 canine influenza viruses using the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool. The assessment found the pandemic risk posed by canine influenza viruses to be low. Prevention Vaccines to protect dogs against H3N2 dog flu are available in the United States. Your veterinarian can provide additional information about these vaccines and whether you should consider vaccinating your dog. Dog owners whose dogs are coughing or showing other signs of respiratory disease should not expose their dog to other dogs or to cats. After exposure to dogs showing signs of respiratory disease, people should clean and disinfect clothing, equipment, surfaces, and hands. Biology Origins of H3N8 Canine Influenza Canine influenza H3N8 viruses originated in horses and spread to dogs. H3N8 equine (horse) influenza (flu) viruses have been known to exist in horses for more than 40 years. In 2004, cases of an unknown respiratory illness in dogs were reported in the United States. An investigation showed that this respiratory illness was caused by equine influenza viruses. Scientists believe that after jumping from horses to dogs, the virus adapted to cause illness in dogs and spread among them. It spreads especially quickly among dogs housed in kennels and shelters. This is now considered a dog-specific (canine) H3N8 virus. In September 2005, this virus was identified by experts as a \"newly emerging pathogen in the dog population\" in the United States. H3N8 canine influenza viruses have not been reported since 2016 and do not appear to be actively circulating anymore. Origins of H3N2 Canine Influenza Canine influenza H3N2 viruses originated in birds and spread to dogs . The first H3N2 canine influenza viruses were reported in 2004. There has also been reported spread of H3N2 canine influenza viruses from dogs to cats. H3N2 canine influenza viruses were first detected in dogs in South Korea in 2007. These viruses have also been reported in dogs in China, Thailand, and Canada. H3N2 canine influenza viruses were first detected in the United States in April 2015 . They have now been found in multiple U.S. states and regions. To date, the H3N2 canine viruses reported in the United States have been almost identical genetically to those previously reported in Asia. Treatment Treatment for dog flu largely consists of supportive care. In milder cases, supportive care may include medication to make your dog more comfortable and fluids to ensure that your dog remains well hydrated. This helps to keep the dog comfortable and hydrated while its body mounts an immune response. Broad spectrum antibiotics may be prescribed by your veterinarian if they suspect a secondary bacterial infection. Dog flu',\n",

Some dogs have asymptomatic infections (no signs of illness), while some have severe illness. Severe illness is characterized by the onset of pneumonia.

Cannabis can be used in a number of ways. How cannabis affects a person depends on several factors. What we know about cannabis Cannabis, which can also be called marijuana, weed, pot, or bud, refers to the dried flowers, leaves, stems, and seeds of the cannabis plant. The cannabis plant contains more than 100 compounds (or cannabinoids). These compounds include tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is impairing or mind-altering, as well as other active compounds, such as cannabidiol (CBD). CBD – by itself - is not impairing, meaning it does not cause a \"high\". 1 Types Cannabis can be used in a number of ways. The most common ways include: 2 3 Smoked in joints (like a cigarette), in blunts (cigars or cigar wrappers that have been partly or completely refilled with cannabis) or in bongs (pipes or water pipes) Vaped using electronic vaporizing devices (like vape pens) or other vaporizers Mixed or infused into foods or drinks (called edibles) like cookies, cakes, or brownies, or tea, cola, or alcohol Additionally, some people inhale the oil concentrates and other extracts from the cannabis plant—this is known as dabbing. THC oils and concentrates used in vaping and dabbing often involve using highly concentrated forms of THC and may contain additives or be contaminated with other substances that may be harmful. 4 How cannabis affects a person depends on several factors, including: 5 6 Concentration of THC used Frequency of cannabis use Use of cannabis with other substances (e.g., alcohol or other drugs), which could increase risk of harm Mode of cannabis use (e.g., consuming edibles or products with high THC concentration can have delayed or unpredictable effects and increases the risk of overdose or poisoning) Previous experience with cannabis or other drugs Biology (e.g., genes, DNA) Sex (e.g., women',\n",

The prescription medication is approved for treating seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of epilepsy (Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome) as well as seizures associated with a rare genetic disorder called tuberous sclerosis complex. The FDA has also approved two medicines (dronabinol [brand names: Marinol and Syndros ] and nabilone [brand name: Cesamet ]) that are made from a synthetic or lab-made chemical that mimics THC. These medicines are used to treat nausea in patients with cancer who are having chemotherapy treatment, and to increase appetite in individuals with AIDS who do not feel like eating (wasting syndrome). These approved products are only available with a prescription from a licensed healthcare provider. There are currently no other FDA-approved uses for cannabis or its derivatives.

A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. Medication is available to treat capillariasis. Without treatment, the infection can be deadly. Overview Capillariasis is a parasitic infection in humans caused by two species of nematodes (roundworms): Capillaria hepatica (C. hepatica) This infection can lead to hepatitis (liver disease). C. hepatica is rare disease in humans (usually affects rodents and other wild animals). Despite this, there have been human cases reported on all continents except Australia. Capillaria philippinesis (C. philippinesis) This infection can lead to diarrhea and emaciation. C. philippinesis is frequently found in the Philippines (especially the Luzon region) and Thailand. There are occasionally cases reported from other East and Southeast Asian countries. Rarely cases have been reported in Egypt, the Middle East, and Colombia. Signs and symptoms C. hepatica People infected with a single C. hepatica worm or a few worms often have no signs or symptoms. Female worms lay eggs continuously and when infections with multiple worms occur, symptoms can be severe, and may include Hepatitis Anemia Fever Hypereosinophilia Death C. philippinensis When people are first infected with C. philippinensis, they can have the following signs and symptoms: General abdominal pain Diarrhea If the diseases are not treated, later on, people can develop severe disease and experience the following signs and symptoms: Nausea Vomiting Weight loss Death How it spreads C. hepatica C. hepatica can be found in the livers of small rodents, monkeys, and prairie dogs, where it can cause cirrhosis (scarring of the liver). When large carnivores eat these animals, they consume the capillarid eggs, which then pass through their stool (poop). When the carnivore poops in soil, the eggs become infective in about 30 days, which can then infect other animals and humans. Alternatively, when the infected rodents, monkeys, or prairie dogs die naturally and decompose, eggs from their livers are released into the soil. If humans consume the eggs from the environment, either directly by eating soil (pica) or indirectly through contaminated food or water, the eggs move to the liver and mature to adult worms.

C. hepatica can be transmitted human-to-human when eggs are deposited through human feces (poop) into the soil. C. philippinensis C. philippinensis is often found in small, freshwater fish. When humans consume raw or undercooked infected fish, larvae move to the intestine and mature to adult worms. Female worms deposit eggs in the intestine, which are then released through feces. When infected human feces reach freshwater, fish can get infected and the cycle continues. In some cases eggs may hatch within the human intestine, causing hyperinfection (a massive number of adult worms). C. philippinensis is not transmitted from infected humans to other humans; transmission requires the intermediate freshwater fish host. However, adult C. philippinensis worms that grow within the intestine of infected humans can release eggs that hatch into larvae; this could cause hyperinfection in that human host. Left untreated, this can lead to severe disease. Prevention You can take steps to prevent both types of capillariasis: Sanitation and hygiene precautions Use sanitation facilities (toilets and latrines) that are out of reach from animals and will not let feces seep into the water or around food supplies. Wash your hands with soap and warm water after touching or working with soil and before handling food. Teach children the importance of handwashing. Food precautions Wash fruits and vegetables before eating them. Do not eat raw or undercooked fish. The FDA recommends the following for fish preparation or storage to kill parasites: Cooking Cook fish adequately (to an internal temperature of at least 145° F [~63° C]). Freezing At -4°F (-20°C) or below for 7 days (total time), or At -31°F (-35°C) or below until solid, and storing at -31°F (-35°C) or below for 15 hours, or At -31°F (-35°C) or below until solid and storing at -4°F (-20°C) or below for 24 hours.

A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. Medication is available to treat capillariasis. Without treatment, the infection can be deadly. Overview Capillariasis is a parasitic infection in humans caused by two species of nematodes (roundworms): Capillaria hepatica (C. hepatica) This infection can lead to hepatitis (liver disease). C. hepatica is rare disease in humans (usually affects rodents and other wild animals). Despite this, there have been human cases reported on all continents except Australia. Capillaria philippinesis (C. philippinesis) This infection can lead to diarrhea and emaciation. C. philippinesis is frequently found in the Philippines (especially the Luzon region) and Thailand. There are occasionally cases reported from other East and Southeast Asian countries. Rarely cases have been reported in Egypt, the Middle East, and Colombia. Signs and symptoms C. hepatica People infected with a single C. hepatica worm or a few worms often have no signs or symptoms. Female worms lay eggs continuously and when infections with multiple worms occur, symptoms can be severe, and may include Hepatitis Anemia Fever Hypereosinophilia Death C. philippinensis When people are first infected with C. philippinensis, they can have the following signs and symptoms: General abdominal pain Diarrhea If the diseases are not treated, later on, people can develop severe disease and experience the following signs and symptoms: Nausea Vomiting Weight loss Death How it spreads C. hepatica C. hepatica can be found in the livers of small rodents, monkeys, and prairie dogs, where it can cause cirrhosis (scarring of the liver). When large carnivores eat these animals, they consume the capillarid eggs, which then pass through their stool (poop). When the carnivore poops in soil, the eggs become infective in about 30 days, which can then infect other animals and humans. Alternatively, when the infected rodents, monkeys, or prairie dogs die naturally and decompose, eggs from their livers are released into the soil. If humans consume the eggs from the environment, either directly by eating soil (pica) or indirectly through contaminated food or water, the eggs move to the liver and mature to adult worms.

People usually get infected if they're bitten by a dog or cat. People with weakened immune systems are at higher risk for infection and serious illness. People bitten by a dog or cat should call a healthcare provider immediately. Overview Many kinds of bacteria are found in the mouths of dogs and cats. One common group of bacteria are called Capnocytophaga. These bacteria sometimes cause opportunistic infections, which means under the right conditions they can cause an infection, such as in a person with a weakened immune system. Capnocytophaga bacteria are commonly found in the mouths of dogs and cats. Capnocytophaga germs can make people sick if they're bitten or the dog or cat's saliva (spit) gets into an open wound or sore. Most people who have contact with a dog or cat do not become sick. People with weakened immune systems who have difficulty fighting off infections are at greater risk of becoming sick if they're bitten. Don't get bitten Read more about how to prevent animal bites and what to do if you do get bitten. Dogs Capnocytophaga infection can cause serious complications, including sepsis , heart attack, kidney failure, and gangrene. Some people may need to have fingers, toes, or limbs amputated. If you have been bitten by a dog or cat, wash the bite area right away with soap and water. Call your doctor or go to an urgent care clinic. Even if you don't feel sick, dog and cat bites can cause a Capnocytophaga infection and other diseases like Pasteurella , Bartonella (cat-scratch disease), or rabies . Other types of Capnocytophaga infection Other Capnocytophaga bacteria can also be found in human mouths. People who have weakened immune systems can sometimes get sick from those bacteria. People who get sick from the kinds of Capnocytophaga found in people’s mouths can get infections in their eyes, gums and mouth tissues, and respiratory tracts (nose, throat, lungs). Signs and symptoms If you have the following symptoms within 14 days of getting bit by a dog or cat, contact a healthcare provider immediately and tell them that you were recently bitten by an animal.\",\n",

Signs and symptoms If you have the following symptoms within 14 days of getting bit by a dog or cat, contact a healthcare provider immediately and tell them that you were recently bitten by an animal. People who are infected with Capnocytophaga can have a range of signs and symptoms: Blisters around the bite area Redness, swelling, draining pus, or pain at the bite area Fever Diarrhea and/or stomach pain Vomiting Headache and/or confusion Muscle or joint pain In all Capnocytophaga infections the bacteria can enter the blood stream, which can lead to infection in various parts of the body (sepsis). Infection can also cause the following: Inflammation of the lining of the heart (endocarditis) Collections of pus, redness, and swelling in various body tissues (abscesses) Inflammation of the eyes, face, lymph nodes, or brain membranes (meningitis) Who's at risk Most dog or cat bites do not lead to a Capnocytophaga infection or any illness. But you should take precautions if you have contact with animals, especially if you have a condition that puts you at higher risk of infection. These conditions include: Having a weakened immune system (immunocompromise) from conditions like cancer, diabetes, or HIV, among others Taking certain medicines that weaken your immune system, such as chemotherapy Not having a spleen (asplenic) Alcohol use disorders If any of these conditions apply to you, speak with your healthcare providers about how to be safe around dogs and cats. Prevention Preventing Capnocytophaga infection starts with preventing bites from dogs and cats, especially if you have a condition that puts you at higher risk of getting sick. Resource There are many benefits to having pets like dogs and cats. CDC's Healthy Pets, Healthy People has tips for safer contact with pets. Treatment Call your healthcare provider immediately after being bitten by a dog or cat. They may recommend starting antibiotics, especially if you have an higher risk of developing an infection. If you do get Capnocytophaga from a bite, your doctor can prescribe specific kinds of antibiotics to help you recover. You may need to take more than one type of antibiotic to find the one that works best.

Find quick facts about CO poisoning and what can be done to prevent it. What it is Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless gas that kills without warning. It claims the lives of hundreds of people every year and makes thousands more ill. Many household items including gas- and oil-burning furnaces, portable generators, and charcoal grills produce this poison gas. Symptoms The most common symptoms of CO poisoning are headache, dizziness, weakness, upset stomach, vomiting, chest pain, and confusion. CO symptoms are often described as “flu-like.” If you breathe in a lot of CO, it can make you pass out or kill you. People who are sleeping, drunk, or under the influence of other substances can die from CO poisoning before they have symptoms. Risk factors Everyone is at risk for CO poisoning. Infants, the elderly, and people with chronic heart disease, anemia, or breathing problems are more likely to get sick from CO. Each year, more than 400 Americans die from unintentional CO poisoning not linked to fires, more than 100,000 visit an emergency department, and more than 14,000 are hospitalized. Reducing risk CO is found in fumes produced any time you burn fuel in cars or trucks, small engines, stoves, lanterns, grills, fireplaces, gas ranges, or furnaces. CO can build up indoors and poison people and animals who breathe it. However, you can reduce your risk of CO poisoning with a few small steps. CO detectors Replace your CO detector following manufacturer instructions Install battery-operated or battery back-up CO detectors near every sleeping area in your home. Check CO detector batteries when you change the time on your clocks each spring and fall to be sure they are functioning properly. Consider buying a detector with a digital readout. This type of detector can tell you the highest level of CO concentration in your home, in addition to sounding an alarm. Replace your CO detector following the manufacturer's instructions or every 5 years. Set a reminder on your smartphone or other\",\n",
       " \"Consider buying a detector with a digital readout. This type of detector can tell you the highest level of CO concentration in your home, in addition to sounding an alarm. Replace your CO detector following the manufacturer's instructions or every 5 years. Set a reminder on your smartphone or other device calendar when you purchase and install the detector. Oil and gas furnaces and other household appliances Have your heating system serviced annually Have your heating system, water heater, and any other gas, oil, or coal burning appliances serviced by a qualified technician every year. Make sure your gas appliances are vented properly. Horizontal vent pipes for appliances, such as a water heater, should go up slightly as they go toward outdoors, as shown below. This prevents CO from leaking if the joints or pipes aren't fitted tightly. When you buy gas equipment, buy only equipment carrying the seal of a national testing agency, such as Underwriters' Laboratories. If you smell an odor from your gas refrigerator, have an expert service it. An odor from your gas refrigerator can mean it could be leaking CO. Never heat your house with a gas oven. Don't cook or burn anything on a stove or fireplace that isn't vented.

Cardiomyopathy can be acquired—developed because of another disease, condition, or factor—or inherited. What it is Cardiomyopathy represents a collection of diverse conditions of the heart muscle. These diseases have many causes, symptoms, and treatments and can affect people of all ages and races. When cardiomyopathy occurs, the normal muscle in the heart can thicken, stiffen, thin out, or fill with substances the body produces that do not belong in the heart muscle. As a result, the heart muscle's ability to pump blood is reduced. This, in turn, can lead to irregular heartbeats, the backup of blood into the lungs or rest of the body, and heart failure. Cardiomyopathy can be acquired—developed because of another disease, condition, or factor—or inherited. The cause isn't always known. The main types of cardiomyopathy include the following: 1 2 3 4 Dilated: meaning that one of the pumping chambers (ventricles) of the heart is enlarged. This is more common in males and is the most common form of cardiomyopathy in children. It can occur at any age and may or may not be inherited. Hypertrophic: where the heart muscle is thickened. This often presents in childhood or early adulthood and can cause sudden death in adolescents and young adult athletes. 1 It is often an inherited condition, and a person may not have any symptoms. If there is a family history of this, other family members can be tested and adjust their activities to reduce the risk of sudden death. Arrhythmogenic: where the disease causes irregular heartbeats or rhythms. This is often inherited and\",\n",
       " \"an inherited condition, and a person may not have any symptoms. If there is a family history of this, other family members can be tested and adjust their activities to reduce the risk of sudden death. Arrhythmogenic: where the disease causes irregular heartbeats or rhythms. This is often inherited and more common in males. Restrictive: where heart muscle is stiff or scarred, or both. It can occur with amyloidosis (a rare disease that occurs when a protein called amyloid builds up in organs), or hemochromatosis (a disorder in which extra iron builds up in the body to harmful levels), and other conditions. This is the least common type. Some people who have cardiomyopathy never have symptoms, while others may show signs as the disease progresses. How common is cardiomyopathy? Cardiomyopathy often goes undiagnosed, 5 so the numbers can vary. As many as 1 of 500 adults may have this condition. 6 7 Males and females of all ages and races can have cardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy is more common in Black people than in White people, and in males than in females. 5 Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is thought to be the most common inherited or genetic heart disease. While this type of cardiomyopathy occurs at many ages, in children and young adults with this condition there may be no symptoms. Yet they are at high risk of sudden cardiac death. Types Pediatric cardiomyopathy Cardiomyopathy can occur in children regardless of age, race, and sex. Pediatric cardiomyopathy can be inherited or acquired through a viral infection, and sometimes the cause is unknown. It is a frequent cause of sudden cardiac arrest in the young, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Treatment may include medications, changes to physical activity, or surgery. In many cases, early detection and intervention can help to improve outcomes for children. Peripartum cardiomyopathy Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a rare form of heart failure that can occur near the end of pregnancy or up to a year after giving birth. The heart muscle becomes weak, causing a buildup of fluid in the lungs. Symptoms include shortness of breath, fatigue, and swollen ankles or legs. Because these symptoms can also occur in a normal pregnancy, recognition and treatment for this condition can be delayed. Women who are pregnant or who have recently delivered a baby should seek medical care immediately if they are experiencing any urgent maternal warning signs . These symptoms could indicate a life-threatening situation. Treatment may include close monitoring by the woman's health care team and prescription medication. Many medicines may be safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding, including diuretics, beta-blockers, or blood thinners. 8 The risk of PPCM is higher for Black women and for women who are older than 30, who are pregnant with more than one fetus, or who have a history of preeclampsia or chronic high blood pressure. 9 Symptoms Some people who have cardiomyopathy never have symptoms, while others may show signs as the disease progresses.

These might include the following: Shortness of breath or trouble breathing. Fatigue. Swelling in the ankles and legs. Irregular heart beat or palpitations. Syncope, the medical term for fainting or briefly passing out. Causes Although the cause of cardiomyopathy is sometimes unknown, certain diseases or conditions can lead to cardiomyopathy. These include the following: 1 2 3 4 A family history of cardiomyopathy, heart failure, or sudden cardiac arrest. Connective tissue disease and other types of autoimmune disease. Coronary heart disease or a heart attack. Diseases that can damage the heart, such as hemochromatosis, sarcoidosis or amyloidosis. Endocrine diseases, including thyroid conditions and diabetes. Infections in the heart muscle. Long-term alcoholism or cocaine abuse. Muscle conditions such as muscular dystrophy. Pregnancy. Treatment and recovery The goal of treatment is to slow down the disease, control symptoms, and prevent sudden death. If you are diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, your doctor may tell you to change your diet and physical activity, reduce stress, avoid alcohol and other drugs, and take medicines. Your doctor may also treat you for the conditions that led to cardiomyopathy, if they exist, or recommend surgery. Treatment also depends on which type of cardiomyopathy you have. Genetic or inherited types of cardiomyopathy cannot be prevented. Adopting or following a healthier lifestyle can help control symptoms and complications. If you have an underlying disease or condition that can cause cardiomyopathy, early treatment of that condition can help prevent the disease from developing.

If you become a caregiver, it\\'s important to take care of your own health too. Facts Caregiving for someone with Alzheimer\\'s disease People with Alzheimer\\'s disease and related dementias are usually cared for by family members or friends. About 80% of adults with Alzheimer\\'s disease and related dementias receive care in their homes. Over 11 million U.S. adults provide unpaid care for someone with a form of dementia. In 2023, caregivers provided about 18.4 billion hours of care to someone with dementia. These caregivers often provide care longer than those caring for people with other conditions. Nearly 1 in 3 of family caregivers of people with Alzheimer\\'s and related dementias provides care for four years or more. Who are caregivers? Approximately two-thirds of dementia caregivers are women. About 1 in 3 caregivers (30%) is 65 or older. About one-quarter are \"sandwich generation\" caregivers. This means that they care for both an aging parent and at least one child under 18. Spotlight Caring for Yourself When Caring for Another Caregiving can be rewarding.

A genetic counselor or healthcare provider can help determine which family members should be tested first. Overview Many people do not know they have a genetic condition until symptoms of that condition begin to affect their lives. By then, treatments might be less likely to work. Cascade testing offers one way of finding people with genetic conditions before they show symptoms, allowing them to take steps to prevent disease or treat it early. How it works If you have been diagnosed with a genetic condition, your family members are more likely to have it, too. Sharing your diagnosis with your family members allows them to learn more and be checked for the condition. Finding and treating a genetic condition early can lead to better health. Family members who are most likely to have the same genetic change, or mutation, are tested first. From there, genetic testing \"cascades\" through the family depending on who has the genetic change and who does not. For example, if genetic testing shows that your mother has the same genetic change that you have, family members on your mother\\'s side would be tested. Your father\\'s side would not need to be tested. How to share your diagnosis with your family members The first step in cascade testing is to let your family members know about your diagnosis and genetic test results. Here are some tips to get started: Gather information to share with your family members. This may include the following: Your diagnosis Your genetic test report(s): Providing a copy of your genetic test report for your family members to take to a genetic counselor may help your family members receive testing quicker. Your lab results related to the condition (such as blood work): Some genetic conditions, such as familial hypercholesterolemia, can be diagnosed without genetic testing. Determine which family members should',\n",

Your lab results related to the condition (such as blood work): Some genetic conditions, such as familial hypercholesterolemia, can be diagnosed without genetic testing. Determine which family members should be tested first. A genetic counselor or medical provider can help you with this. Your children, sisters, brothers, and parents are most likely to have the same genetic condition. Testing should start with them, with the limitation that genetic testing for adult-onset conditions is not generally done in children. If a family member is not available for testing (for example, the family member does not want to be tested or has died), then moving to more distant family members is appropriate. Decide how you would like to share the information with your family members. Below are some options: Talk to your family members directly. Your genetic counselor can help you plan how to tell your family members, including what information is most important. Write a letter explaining your diagnosis, including any related genetic testing and lab results. Sample letters are available for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer , Lynch syndrome , and familial hypercholesterolemia . Ask a family member to help you tell other members in your family. If you are unsure of how to contact certain family members, having another family member contact them may help you get the information out to more family members. Ask family members to attend a genetic counseling or doctor's appointment with you. If you are unsure or concerned about how to describe the condition to your family, a genetic counselor or doctor can assist. In addition, your doctor or genetic counselor might be able to provide a family letter explaining your diagnosis. Sample letters are available for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and Lynch syndrome . Common questions What if my family members do not want to talk about hereditary conditions and cascade testing? Talking about having an increased risk of developing cancer, heart disease, or other hereditary conditions may be difficult for some family members. Before talking to family members about their risk of having the same genetic change, it could be helpful to anticipate possible reactions. For example, if you think that a family member might get emotional from learning this information, it might be best to tell them about this in a comfortable, private area. If a family member refuses to talk about this information, it is important to respect their decision. Some people do not want to know about their risks for developing certain diseases because it will cause them too much anxiety. However, you can offer them other options, so they can get the information on their own terms. For example, you can provide them information on how to talk to a genetic counselor or give them a letter that they can open whenever they are ready. Sample letters are available for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer ,\",\n",

Sample letters are available for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer , Lynch syndrome , and familial hypercholesterolemia . How do I talk to my children? The process of talking to children about hereditary conditions may differ from talking to adult family members. Your children’s immediate concern might be how the condition will affect your health and the impact that will have on them. Your child’s age may affect how you talk to them about your condition and their chances of having it. For younger children, it may be helpful to tell them smaller pieces of information over time to allow them time to process the information you share. Older children may want to learn all the information in one conversation, and then want to talk to a medical provider about their own health risks. A genetic counselor can help you plan how to tell your children about your condition and their risks, and provide information on when your children should get genetic testing. Next steps After sharing this information with your family members, they may ask you what they should do. Below are some tips to help your family members get checked for the genetic condition: Your family members can get genetic counseling . A genetic counselor can help your family members order genetic tests. You can contact your genetic counselor for help, or you can find other genetic counselors using the National Society of Genetic Counselors directory . Genetic counselors are available through in-person and telehealth appointments. Encourage your family members to tell their healthcare providers about your diagnosis. Their healthcare providers can help them determine the best management plan. Important topics to discuss Family members may have some concerns after you share this information with them. You and your family members might want to talk to a medical provider or genetic counselor about the following: Genetic testing may be free: Some genetic testing companies offer free cascade testing for family members. Contact your genetic counselor or doctor who ordered your testing to see if your family members qualify. In some cases, free testing is only available for a certain amount of time after a family member's genetic test. Insurance protections: Genetic test results are protected under the Genetic Information Non-discrimination Act (GINA) . This legislation prohibits health insurance companies and employers from discriminating against an individual based on their genetic information. However, GINA does not protect individuals from discrimination by life, disability, or long-term care insurance companies. Community support: You and your family members might find it helpful to connect with others with the same genetic condition. One way to do this is through online support groups such as Kintalk , FORCE (Cancer) , the Family Heart Foundation (familial hypercholesterolemia) , and Genetic Alliance (rare genetic disorders) .

Why it matters CAUTIs are one of the most common HAIs. About 75% of UTIs developed in hospitals are associated with a urinary catheter. 15-25% of hospitalized patients receive urinary catheters during their hospital stay. CAUTIs are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, healthcare costs and length of stay. They are preventable. Background A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection that involves any of the organs or structures of the urinary tract, (e.g., kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra). A CAUTI occurs when germs (usually bacteria) enter the urinary tract through the urinary catheter and cause infection. Recommendations All healthcare facilities Only use urinary catheters when needed. Place catheters using proper germ-free techniques with sterile equipment. Maintain the catheter's closed sterile drainage system. Remove catheters as soon as patients no longer need them. Prolonged use is the most important risk factor for CAUTIs. Healthcare facilities should follow the 2009 CDC Guideline for Prevention of Catheter-associated Urinary Tract Infections . The guideline emphasizes the proper use, insertion, and maintenance of urinary catheters in different healthcare settings. It also presents effective quality improvement programs that healthcare facilities can use to prevent CAUTIs. Acute care hospitals Acute care hospitals should follow Strategies to Prevent Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infections in Acute Care Hospitals: 2022 Update . Assessment tools Facilities can monitor CAUTI rates and assess the effectiveness of prevention efforts through CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) . Facilities can also identify infection prevention gaps and launch tailored interventions to reduce CAUTI risk with the Targeted Assessment for Prevention (TAP) Strategy .

CLABSIs are preventable. Overview Importance Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) result in thousands of deaths each year and billions of dollars in added costs to the U.S. healthcare system – but they are preventable. Central lines A central line (also known as a central venous catheter) is a catheter (tube) that healthcare providers often place in a large vein in the neck, chest or groin. Central lines are different from peripheral IVs (shorter IVs placed in the hand, arm or foot for vein access); central lines access a major vein close to the heart, can remain in place for weeks or months, and are much more likely to be a source of serious infection. Central lines are commonly used in intensive care units. Purpose of central lines Give medicines for treatment of pain, infection or other medical issues (e.g., cancer or heart problems). Provide fluids or nutrition. Help conduct certain medical tests. Types Types of central lines Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) . Placed into a vein in the arm. Tunneled catheter. Passed under the skin and placed into a vein in the chest or neck. Providers can insert medicine right into the catheter. Implanted port. Surgically placed under the skin. Providers insert medicines using a needle placed through the skin into the catheter. An implanted port is not as visible as a tunneled catheter, does not require as much daily care, and does not get in the way of a patient's regular activities as much as a PICC line or a tunneled catheter might. Healthcare providers use the type that is best for each patient's care. Signs and symptoms People with CLABSIs may experience: Fever Red skin and soreness around the central line Causes CLABSIs occur when germs (usually bacteria or fungi) enter the bloodstream through the central line.

It can cause an allergic reaction and rash on your skin. Swimmer's itch is not contagious and does not spread from person to person. Overview Swimmer’s itch, also called cercarial dermatitis, appears as a skin rash caused by an allergic reaction to certain microscopic parasites that infect some birds and mammals. These parasites are released from infected snails into fresh and salt water (such as lakes, ponds, and oceans). While the parasite’s preferred host is the specific bird or mammal, if the parasite comes into contact with a swimmer, it burrows into the skin causing an allergic reaction and rash. Swimmer’s itch is found throughout the world and is more frequent during summer months. Symptoms Symptoms can include tingling, burning, or itching of the skin small reddish pimples small blisters Within minutes to days after swimming in contaminated water, you may experience tingling, burning, or itching of the skin. Small reddish pimples appear within twelve hours. Pimples may develop into small blisters. Scratching the areas may result in secondary bacterial infections. Itching may last up to a week or more but will gradually go away. Because swimmer’s itch is caused by an allergic reaction to infection, the more often you swim or wade in contaminated water, the more likely you are to develop more serious symptoms. The greater the number of exposures to contaminated water, the more intense and immediate symptoms of swimmer’s itch will be. Be aware that swimmer's itch is not the only rash that may occur after swimming in fresh or salt water. Exposure risks Anyone who swims or wades in infested water may be at risk. Larvae are more likely to be present in shallow water by the shoreline. Children are most often affected because they tend to swim, wade, and play in the shallow water more than adults. Also, they are less likely to towel dry themselves when leaving the water. Water safety after outbreaks Many factors must be present for swimmer’s itch to become a problem in water. Since these factors change (sometimes within a swim season), swimmer’s itch will not always be a problem. However, there is no way to know\",\n",
       " \"to towel dry themselves when leaving the water. Water safety after outbreaks Many factors must be present for swimmer’s itch to become a problem in water. Since these factors change (sometimes within a swim season), swimmer’s itch will not always be a problem. However, there is no way to know how long water may be unsafe. Larvae generally survive for 24 hours once they are released from the snail. However, an infected snail will continue to produce cercariae throughout the remainder of its life. For future snails to become infected, migratory birds or mammals in the area must also be infected so the lifecycle can continue. Swimming pools As long as your swimming pool is well maintained and chlorinated, there is no risk of swimmer’s itch. The appropriate snails must be present in order for swimmer’s itch to occur. Resource\\u200e Prevent Swimming-related Illnesses How it spreads The adult parasite lives in the blood of infected animals such as ducks, geese, gulls, swans, and certain mammals such as muskrats and raccoons. The parasites produce eggs that are passed in the feces of infected birds or mammals. If the eggs land in or are washed into the water, the eggs hatch, releasing small, free-swimming microscopic larvae. These larvae swim in the water in search of a certain species of aquatic snail. If the larvae find one of these snails, they infect the snail, multiply and undergo further development. Infected snails release a different type of microscopic larvae (or cercariae, hence the name cercarial dermatitis) into the water. This larval form then swims about searching for a suitable host (bird, muskrat) to continue the lifecycle. Although humans are not suitable hosts, the microscopic larvae burrow into the swimmer’s skin, and may cause an allergic reaction and rash. Because these larvae cannot develop inside a human, they soon die. Reducing risk To reduce the likelihood of developing swimmer’s itch Do not swim in areas where swimmer's itch is a known problem or where signs have been posted warning of unsafe water. Do not swim near or wade in marshy areas where snails are commonly found. Towel dry or shower immediately after leaving the water. Do not attract birds (e.g., by feeding them) to areas where people are swimming. Encourage health officials to post signs on shorelines where swimmer's itch is a current problem. Resource\\u200e How to Safely visit Oceans, Lakes, and Rivers Treatment Most cases of swimmer’s itch do not require medical attention. If you have a rash, you may try the following for relief: Use corticosteroid cream Apply cool compresses to the affected areas Bathe in Epsom salts or baking soda Soak in colloidal oatmeal baths Apply baking soda paste to the rash (made by stirring water into baking soda until it reaches a paste-like consistency) Use an anti-itch lotion Though difficult, try not to scratch. Scratching may cause the rash to become infected. If itching is severe, your health care provider may suggest prescription-strength lotions or creams to lessen your symptoms. On\",\n",

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Other federal privacy laws. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) The HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR Parts 160 and 164 ) regulates the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, called protected health information (PHI), by covered entities. The Privacy Rule protects all PHI transmitted or maintained in any form or medium (e.g. electronic, paper, or oral) by a covered entity or its business associates. It excludes certain educational and employment records. The Privacy Rule gives individuals certain rights in respect to their health information including, but not limited to, the right to inspect and request corrections or amendments to their PHI. The Privacy Rule requires covered entities to notify individuals of their privacy rights and how their PHI will be used and disclosed. The Privacy Rule generally prohibits the use or disclosure of PHI without the written authorization from the individual; however, there are several exceptions to this requirement including disclosures for public health activities. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. §1232g; 34 CFR Part 99 ) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records.

The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education. FERPA gives parents certain rights regarding their child's education record. These rights include the right to inspect and request corrections to the record. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school level. FERPA generally prohibits the disclosure of any personally identifiable information contained in an education record without the appropriate written consent. FERPA offers limited exceptions to this requirement. Confidentiality Certificates of Confidentiality Certificates of Confidentiality (CoCs) protect the privacy of research participants by prohibiting disclosure of identifiable and potentially identifiable research information, with limited exceptions. Any investigator or institution issued a CoC shall not: Disclose or provide covered information, in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceeding. Disclose or provide covered information to any other person not connected with the research. CDC investigators with a CoC may ONLY disclose identifiable and potentially identifiable information in the following circumstances: If required by other federal, state, or local laws, such as for reporting of communicable diseases. If the subject consents. For the purposes of scientific research that is compliant with human subjects' regulations. CoCs cover any CDC-funded research project collecting or using identifiable and potentially identifiable information, in compliance with Section 301(d) of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). All CDC-funded research activities are automatically issued a CoC through their award. No physical certificate will be issued. The CoC will apply as a term and condition of award. This applies to: Grants. Cooperative Agreements. Contracts. CDC-sponsored intramural research. For research activities enrolling human participants, CDC requires investigators to inform participants of the CoC protections and the limits to those protections. Assurance of Confidentiality An Assurance of Confidentiality (AoC) is a formal confidentiality protection authorized under Section 308(d) of the PHSA. CDC investigators use it to collect or maintain sensitive identifiable information from individuals and institutions. The law states that no identifiable information may be used for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was supplied. The exception is if such institution or individual consented to that disclosure. Protected information includes identifiable information on institutions or individuals who are the subjects of non-research, public health activities with an approved AoC. CDC implements agency AoC protection for public health activities conducted by CDC investigators that involve the collection or maintenance of identifiable information. This protection allows CDC programs to assure individuals and institutions involved in non-research activities (e.g., surveillance) that those conducting the activity will protect the confidentiality of the identifiable data collected.

Chapare is deadly; about 60% of people with the disease die. There is no specific treatment for Chapare. A limited number of Chapare outbreaks have been reported, all in Bolivia. What it is Chapare hemorrhagic fever (Chapare) is an illness caused by infection with the Chapare virus. This virus can spread to people through contact with the saliva, urine, and droppings of infected rodents. Chapare virus has caused a small number of documented outbreaks, all in Bolivia. All outbreaks have been limited in scale, with no evidence of sustained community transmission. The first outbreak consisted of one fatal case reported in 2003 in Chapare Province. In 2019, the virus reemerged in Caranavi, where nine cases were reported with four deaths. Health authorities confirmed some of these cases were from person-to-person transmission among healthcare workers. In 2025, two separate cases were detected in La Paz Department. Because Chapare can cause severe disease and because it can potentially spread in healthcare facilities, Chapare remains a public health concern. Healthcare providers: Review guidance on emergency services, screening, testing, infection control and PPE for viral hemorrhagic fevers like Chapare. Signs and symptoms Chapare symptoms are like those of other South American hemorrhagic fevers, such as Argentine hemorrhagic fever or Bolivian hemorrhagic fever. Due to the low number of reported Chapare cases, there is limited information about the disease. Documented signs and symptoms of Chapare include: Fever Headache Joint and muscle pain Pain behind the eyes Stomach pain, vomiting, and diarrhea Bleeding gums Rash Irritability Evidence suggests that pregnant women who are infected with Chapare virus may have complications, including miscarriage or death of the mother or newborn. How it spreads People can become infected with the Chapare virus by: Being bitten or scratched by an infected rodent Eating foods contaminated with the saliva, urine, or droppings from infected rodents Being in close contact with body fluids of an infected person Breathing in the virus when it is stirred up into the air It is unknown if Chapare virus can be spread from mother to child during birth. However, other similar viruses are known to infect the fetus when it is in the uterus. Prevention\",\n",
       " 'body fluids of an infected person Breathing in the virus when it is stirred up into the air It is unknown if Chapare virus can be spread from mother to child during birth. However, other similar viruses are known to infect the fetus when it is in the uterus. Prevention Chapare virus has not been detected outside of Bolivia. If you are in an area of Bolivia where the virus has been detected: Avoid areas that are infested with rodents and other small mammals. Avoid areas where you see signs of rodent infestation like droppings. Avoid contact with the body fluids of people who are sick with Chapare. Healthcare providers should use standard contact and droplet precautions with eye protection while managing suspected or confirmed Chapare cases. They should use airborne precautions when performing procedures that could cause the virus to spray into the air. Keep Reading Prevent rodent infestations Testing and Diagnosis Healthcare providers can diagnose Chapare with blood tests that detect the virus, like polymerase chain reaction (PCR). There are currently no antibody tests that can tell if someone had the virus in the past. Clinicians should notify their state or local health department if a patient has recently been in an area with Chapare virus and has compatible symptoms. Treatment and recovery There is currently no specific treatment for Chapare. Supportive therapy can help people recover from and survive. This includes: Providing fluids and electrolytes (body salts) Using medication to support blood pressure, reduce vomiting and diarrhea, and manage fever and pain Treating other infections, if they occur Even months after symptoms stop, people who recover from Chapare may continue to shed the virus in their blood, saliva, urine, or semen. Healthcare providers should monitor these fluids for Chapare virus. Recovering patients could possibly infect others, particularly sexual partners or other household members.

No single personal protective ensemble can protect from exposure to all hazards. The appropriate combination of respirator, protective ensemble and other equipment should be selected based on a conclusive hazard assessment. Best practices When other control methods within the hierarchy of controls are unable to reduce the hazardous exposure to safe levels, employers must provide Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Like all PPE, protective clothing and ensembles should be used in the context of a comprehensive PPE program that includes hazard assessment, training, and medical monitoring among other necessary elements. Consult the OSHA standards for specific requirements concerning selection and use of PPE. In general, PPE is should be safe, durable, clean, and reliable. Fit and comfort are important considerations when selecting PPE.

Overview Roughly every 8 minutes, call data from poison centers across the country are uploaded to a national reporting database and electronic surveillance system called the National Poison Data System (NPDS). CDC and America's Poison Centers use the database to improve surveillance of chemical exposures and public health hazards. How it works Scientists from CDC and America's Poison Centers monitor NPDS every day. They watch for any data anomalies that may represent incidents of public health significance such as outbreaks of illness. Anomalies can include an increase in the number of calls or an increase in reports of specific signs and symptoms. When anomalies are identified, CDC and America's Poison Centers assist with further activities. This can include performing enhanced surveillance or notifying the state health department and assisting with a public health investigation. Learn how public health surveillance identifies and responds to incidents of public health significance from poison center data with this flowchart . Contacting your poison center You can contact your local poison center by calling 1-800-222-1222. You will automatically be connected to the poison center covering your area. For an online option, the PoisonHelp.org interactive tool prompts users to answer a few simple questions about their exposure to one of the approximately 325,000 unique products and substances in the system.

       " \"monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless gas that can lead to sudden illness or death if inhaled at high concentrations. After a disaster, there may be power outages. This can result in people using alternative sources of fuel or electricity for heating, cooling, or cooking. These sources can lead to elevated CO levels in enclosed spaces, poisoning people and animals inside. CDC uses NPDS for surveillance during disaster response and recovery efforts to track reported exposures to CO. Using these data can help inform public health messaging to prevent further injury and death. Identifying an increase in exposures to cleaners and disinfectants (2020) In April 2020, CDC published a report that described an increase in calls to poison centers about exposures to cleaners and disinfectants. Using data from NPDS, CDC and America's Poison Centers found that poison centers nationwide received 45,550 calls regarding exposures to cleaners and disinfectants during the first three months of 2020-an increase of about 20% from the same timeframe in 2019. The timing of these reported exposures corresponded to increased media coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic, reports of consumer shortages of cleaning and disinfection products, and the beginning of some local and state stay-at-home orders. The results of this study highlighted the importance of safe and appropriate use of cleaners and disinfectants to prevent potential poisonings and injuries. Identifying sources of harmful algal and cyanobacterial bloom exposures (2019) Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are the rapid growth of algae or cyanobacteria that can cause harm to people, animals, and the environment. In 2019, CDC and America’s Poison Centers worked with five poison centers to conduct follow-up surveys with people who had called regarding a HAB exposure. Fifty-five people were interviewed. Most callers (65%) stated they were exposed through multiple routes with the most common being skin contact (84%) and ingestion (60%). The most frequently reported source of exposure was bathing or swimming in contaminated water. Few callers had heard or read warnings about the dangers of HABs before or during their exposure. This study highlights the importance of characterizing exposures to HABs to tailor public health messaging. Increasing awareness of synthetic cannabinoids (2015) CDC launched an investigation in April 2015 after being alerted to an increase in poison center calls related to synthetic cannabinoids, also known as synthetic marijuana. The results, published in MMWR , led to a surge in media coverage on this issue that created a broader awareness of issues and dangers of using synthetic cannabinoids. Reporting poisoning from electronic cigarettes (2014) Electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes, are devices that heat a liquid mixture to allow users to inhale an aerosol that typically contains nicotine, flavorings, and other additives. While long-term impacts of these products on public health are unknown, one area of concern is the potential for poisonings. A CDC study found that 2,405 e-cigarette exposures were reported to poison centers from September 2010 to February 2014. This work informed public health actions including the Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act of 2015, enacted in January\",\n",
       " \"public health are unknown, one area of concern is the potential for poisonings. A CDC study found that 2,405 e-cigarette exposures were reported to poison centers from September 2010 to February 2014. This work informed public health actions including the Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act of 2015, enacted in January 2016. This law requires any container of liquid nicotine that is sold, manufactured, distributed, or imported into the United States use packaging that is difficult for children under 5 years of age to open. Improving consumer safety for laundry pods (2012) From May 17–June 17, 2012, poison centers across the country reported 485 cases of children being exposed to detergent-filled laundry pods. CDC partnered with America's Poison Centers and poison centers in Charlotte and Philadelphia to investigate this public health threat. Their work helped contribute to the decision by the largest manufacturer of laundry detergent pods in the United States to add a double latch lid safety feature to their containers. Manufacturers have also worked with poison centers to study risk factors and health outcomes linked to laundry detergent pod exposures. Tracking concerns during Japan radiological event (2011) CDC tracked all calls to poison centers related to the 2011 Japan nuclear event. Between March 11 and April 18, NPDS tracked 340 information requests and 64 calls regarding potential radiation, potassium iodide and iodide product exposures. Call details were analyzed daily for situational awareness and to inform public health response efforts. Staff from CDC and America’s Poison Centers performed detailed follow up and data review to confirm exposure status. Surveillance for calls related to potassium iodide (a medication used to prevent the uptake of radioactive iodine by the thyroid) exposures documented adverse outcomes in persons taking this product in response to a perceived risk from this event. Oil exposures from Deepwater Horizon incident (2010) During 2010, 1838 calls were received by 57 poison centers related to the Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill. Of these, 1,160 were self-reported exposures and symptoms, including cough, nausea, headache, eye irritation, throat irritation, chest pain, dizziness, difficulty breathing, and rash. The data were used to identify trends and monitor severity of health effects. This information helped public health officials determine the impact of the oil spill on health. Information was also shared with states to aid in their public health response.

Soreness in your chest and feeling tired? You could have a chest cold, often called acute bronchitis. A virus usually causes chest colds. Antibiotics will not help you get better if you have a chest cold. If you're healthy without heart or lung problems or a weakened immune system, this information is for you. Overview A chest cold, often called acute bronchitis, occurs when the airways of the lungs swell and produce mucus in the lungs. That's what makes you cough. Swelling of airways in the lungs produce mucus in the lungs and makes you cough. Signs and symptoms The most common symptom of acute bronchitis is coughing with or without mucus. Symptoms of acute bronchitis last less than 3 weeks. Other symptoms can include: Soreness in the chest Feeling tired (fatigue) Mild headache Mild body aches Sore throat Causes A virus usually causes acute bronchitis. Bacteria can sometimes cause acute bronchitis. Prevention You can help prevent acute bronchitis by doing your best to stay healthy and keep others healthy, including: Clean your hands . Get recommended vaccines, such as the flu vaccine . Don't smoke and avoid secondhand smoke. Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing. When to seek medical care Temperature of 100.4 °F or higher. Cough with bloody mucus. Shortness of breath or trouble breathing. Symptoms that last more than 3 weeks. Repeated episodes of bronchitis. This list is not all-inclusive. Please see a healthcare provider for any symptom that is severe or concerning. Talk to a healthcare provider right away\\u200e If your child is under 3 months old with a fever of 100.4 °F (38 °C) or higher. Treatment Acute bronchitis usually gets better on its own—without antibiotics. When antibiotics aren't needed, they won't help you, and their side effects could still cause harm. Side effects can range from mild reactions, like a rash, to more serious health problems.

       " \"can range from mild reactions, like a rash, to more serious health problems. These problems can include severe allergic reactions, antimicrobial-resistant infections and C. diff infection. C. diff causes diarrhea that can lead to severe colon damage and death. How to feel better Get plenty of rest. Drink plenty of fluids. Use a clean humidifier or cool mist vaporizer. Use saline nasal spray or drops to relieve a stuffy nose. For young children, use a rubber suction bulb to clear mucus. Breathe in steam from a bowl of hot water or shower. Use throat lozenges or cough drops. Do not give lozenges to children younger than 4 years of age. Use honey to relieve cough for adults and children at least 1 year of age or older. Ask your healthcare provider about over-the-counter medicines that can help you feel better. Always use over-the-counter medicines as directed. Remember, over-the-counter medicines may provide temporary relief of symptoms, but they will not cure your illness. Over-the-counter medicine and children Carefully read and follow instructions on over-the-counter medicine product labels before giving medicines to children. Some over-the-counter medicines are not recommended for children of certain ages. Pain relievers: Children younger than 6 months: only give acetaminophen. Children 6 months or older: it is OK to give acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Never give aspirin to children because it can cause Reye's syndrome. Reye's syndrome is a very serious, but rare illness that can harm the liver and brain. Cough and cold medicines: Children younger than 4 years old: do not use over-the-counter cough and cold medicines in young children unless a healthcare provider specifically tells you to. Cough and cold medicines can result in serious and sometimes life-threatening side effects in young children. Children 4 years or older: discuss with your child's healthcare provider if over-the-counter cough and cold medicines are safe to give to your child. Ask your healthcare provider about the right dosage of over-the-counter medicines for your child's age and size. Also, tell your child's healthcare provider about all prescription and over-the-counter medicines they are taking. Similar diseases Other illnesses like whooping cough (pertussis) or pneumonia can have similar symptoms to acute bronchitis. If you have whooping cough or pneumonia, your healthcare provider will most likely prescribe antibiotics. Resources Virus vs. Bacteria What's Got You Sick?

People who have never had chickenpox or received chickenpox vaccine should get 2 doses. Most people who get the vaccine will be protected for life and not get chickenpox. Introduction The best way to protect against chickenpox is to get the chickenpox vaccine. The chickenpox vaccine prevents almost all cases of severe illness. Instead of MMRV, some children might receive separate vaccines for MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) and varicella (chickenpox). If a vaccinated person does get chickenpox, called breakthrough chickenpox, the symptoms are usually mild. Vaccinated people often experience fewer to no blisters and low or no fever, but red spots may occur.

After exposure to someone with chickenpox Getting vaccinated after you are exposed to someone with chickenpox can: Prevent the disease or make it less serious. Protect you from chickenpox if you are exposed again in the future. A healthcare provider can prescribe a medicine to make chickenpox less severe if you: Are exposed to chickenpox. Do not have immunity against the disease. Are not eligible for vaccination. Why getting vaccinated is important Chickenpox is usually mild. However, it can be serious during pregnancy, in infants under 12 months old, adolescents, adults, and people with weakened immune systems. Some people get so sick that they need to be hospitalized. It doesn’t happen often, but people can die from chickenpox. Most people who are vaccinated with 2 doses of chickenpox vaccine will be protected for life. Chickenpox is a mild disease for many children, but not for all. There's no way to know who will have a serious case. With vaccination, your children get immunity from chickenpox without the risk of serious complications caused by the disease itself. Who should get vaccinated Everyone should get 2 doses of chickenpox vaccine if they have never had chickenpox or were never vaccinated.

Vaccines for Children Program Your children may be able to get no-cost vaccines through the Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program . This program helps families of eligible children who may not be able to afford or have access to vaccines. Common questions What are the childcare & school vaccine requirements? All 50 states and DC have state laws that require children entering childcare or students starting schools to have certain vaccinations. There is no federal law that requires this. The ACIP recommends that all states require these groups to be up to date on chickenpox vaccine. Students in school settings have a higher likelihood of spreading chickenpox because they are constantly in close contact with each other.

These needs include housing, food, clothing, education, access to medical care, and having feelings validated and appropriately responded to. 1 For more information about child abuse and neglect definitions please see Child Maltreatment Surveillance: Uniform Definitions for Public Health and Recommended Data Elements [4.12 MB, 148 Pages, 508] . Quick facts and stats Child abuse and neglect are common. At least one in seven children experienced child abuse or neglect in the past year in the United States. 2 This is likely an underestimate because many cases are unreported.

       " \"year in the United States. 2 This is likely an underestimate because many cases are unreported. In 2021, 1,820 children died of abuse and neglect in the United States. 3 Children living in poverty experience more abuse and neglect. Experiencing poverty can place a lot of stress on families, which may increase the risk for child abuse and neglect. Rates of child abuse and neglect are five times higher for children in families with low socioeconomic status compared to families with a higher socioeconomic status. Child maltreatment is costly. In the United States, the total lifetime economic burden associated with child abuse and neglect was about $592 billion in 2018. 4 This economic burden rivals the cost of other high-profile public health problems, such as heart disease and diabetes. 5 Outcomes Children who are abused or neglected may suffer immediate physical injuries such as cuts, bruises, or broken bones. They may also have emotional and psychological problems, such as anxiety or posttraumatic stress. Over the long term, children who are abused or neglected are also at increased risk for experiencing future violence victimization and perpetration, substance abuse, sexually transmitted infections, delayed brain development, lower educational attainment, and limited employment opportunities. Abuse and neglect may result in toxic stress, which can change brain development and increase the risk for problems like posttraumatic stress disorder and learning, attention, and memory difficulties. 6 Prevention Child abuse and neglect can be prevented. Certain factors may increase or decrease the risk of perpetrating or experiencing child abuse and neglect. Preventing child abuse and neglect requires understanding and addressing the factors that put people at risk for or protect them from violence. 7 Everyone benefits when children have safe, stable, nurturing relationships and environments. We all have role to play. Keep Reading: Preventing Child Abuse and Neglect On This Page What are child abuse and neglect?

Child sexual abuse can have a long-term impact on health, opportunity, and well-being. What is child sexual abuse? Child sexual abuse refers to the involvement of a child (person less than 18 years old) in sexual activity that violates the laws or social taboos of society and that the child 1 : Does not fully comprehend. Does not consent to or is unable to give informed consent to. Is not developmentally prepared for and cannot give consent to. Quick facts and stats Many children wait to report or never report child sexual abuse. Therefore, the numbers below likely underestimate the true impact of the problem. Although estimates vary across studies, the research shows: At least one in four girls and one in 20 boys in the United States experience child sexual abuse. 2 3 4 About 90% of child sexual abuse is perpetrated by someone known and trusted by the child or child's family members. 5 The total lifetime economic burden of child sexual abuse in the United States in 2015 was estimated to be at least $9.3 billion. 6 Outcomes Experiencing child sexual abuse can affect how a person thinks, acts, and feels over a lifetime. This can result in short- and long-term physical, mental, and behavioral health consequences, 7 such as... Physical health consequences: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs). 8 Physical injuries. 9 Chronic conditions later in life, such as heart disease, obesity, and cancer. 10 Mental health consequences: Depression. 11 Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. 11 B ehavioral consequences : Substance use/misuse, including opioid misuse. 12 Risky sexual behaviors, meaning sex with multiple partners or behaviors that could result in pregnancy or STIs. 10 13 Increased risk for perpetration of sexual violence. 14 15 Increased risk for suicide or suicide attempts. 16 Experiencing child sexual abuse can also increase a person’s\",\n",
       " 'use/misuse, including opioid misuse. 12 Risky sexual behaviors, meaning sex with multiple partners or behaviors that could result in pregnancy or STIs. 10 13 Increased risk for perpetration of sexual violence. 14 15 Increased risk for suicide or suicide attempts. 16 Experiencing child sexual abuse can also increase a person’s risk for future victimization. For example, women who experienced child sexual abuse are at two to 13 times increased risk for experiencing sexual violence in adulthood. 17 18 19 Additionally, people who experienced child sexual abuse are at twice the risk for experiencing non-sexual intimate partner violence. 20 Prevention Child sexual abuse is preventable. Adults are responsible for ensuring that children have safe, stable, nurturing relationships and environments. Resources for child sexual abuse have mostly focused on treatment for victims and criminal justice-oriented approaches for people who commit child sexual abuse. These efforts are important after child sexual abuse has occurred. However, little investment has been made in preventing child sexual abuse. Until recently, there have been few effective evidence-based strategies available to proactively protect children from child sexual abuse. More resources are needed to develop, evaluate, disseminate, and implement evidence-based child sexual abuse primary prevention strategies. These strategies can help ensure that all children have safe, stable, nurturing relationships and environments. What CDC is doing CDC surveillance systems, violence prevention initiatives, and efforts to support partners in the field have increased our understanding of child sexual abuse. However, there are still critical gaps. Additional efforts in child sexual abuse prevention are needed to: Improve surveillance systems and data collection for monitoring child sexual abuse. Increase our understanding of risk and protective factors for child sexual abuse perpetration and victimization. Strengthen existing and develop new evidence-based policies, programs, and practices for the primary prevention of child sexual abuse through rigorous evaluation research. Increase dissemination and implementation of evidence-based strategies for child sexual abuse prevention. CDC has developed Prevention Resources for Action , formerly known as \"technical packages,\" to help states and communities use the best available evidence to prevent various types of violence. Since 2020, CDC has funded nine research cooperative agreements focused on the primary prevention of child sexual abuse. These research studies include both policy and program evaluations at the community, state, and national levels. These studies support the vision of a violence-free society in which all people and communities are safe, healthy, and thriving. On This Page What is child sexual abuse?

Symptoms may go away or continue into adulthood. While there is no cure for childhood arthritis, there are ways to manage and treat it. Overview Arthritis that develops in children is called childhood arthritis (or juvenile arthritis). A 1 Childhood arthritis begins when the immune system becomes overactive, leading to joint and body swelling. Childhood arthritis can cause pain, loss of motion, and permanent damage in the joints. This can make it hard for a child to walk, play, or dress themselves. It can also result in disability. Living with childhood arthritis About 220,000 U.S. children under 18 have arthritis. 1 Childhood arthritis is more common among certain groups in the United States, including children who are Black or African American and whose parents have lower levels of education. Signs and symptoms The symptoms of childhood arthritis may be different for every child. They can include: Joint pain. Swelling. Fever. Stiffness. Rash. Feeling tired. Loss of appetite. There may be times when symptoms get worse, known as \"flares.\" There may also be times when symptoms get better, known as \"remission.\" Causes The causes of childhood arthritis are not known. Who gets childhood arthritis Any child can develop arthritis. But arthritis is more common in children who: 1 Have anxiety or depression. Have a heart condition. Have overweight. Are not physically active. Live with people who smoke. Diagnosis Symptoms of childhood arthritis might seem like other illnesses and injuries. A pediatric rheumatologist, who specializes in childhood arthritis, can help figure out the right diagnosis. These doctors can diagnose childhood arthritis by doing: A physical exam. X-rays. Lab tests. A review of health history.

Many children ingest lead dust by putting objects such as toys and dirt in their mouths. The goal of CDC's Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program (CLPPP) is to prevent childhood lead exposure before any harm occurs. Overview Lead is a naturally occurring metal that can cause negative health effects. People are exposed to lead by eating lead paint chips, ingesting contaminated food or water, and/or by breathing in lead dust. Children younger than 6 years are more likely to be exposed due to their hand-to-mouth behavior. Many children ingest lead dust by putting objects such as toys and dirt in their mouths. Lead in blood No safe blood lead level (BLL) in children has been identified. Even low levels of lead in blood are associated with developmental delays, difficulty learning, and behavioral issues. The effects of lead poisoning can be permanent and disabling. There are steps that parents and healthcare providers can take to protect children from lead exposure . Healthcare providers can perform a blood lead test if a child was or may have been exposed to lead. CDC uses a blood lead reference value (BLRV) of 3.5 micrograms per deciliter (µg/dL). This reference level helps identify children with BLLs higher than most children's levels. CDC estimates that approximately\",\n",
       " \"Healthcare providers can perform a blood lead test if a child was or may have been exposed to lead. CDC uses a blood lead reference value (BLRV) of 3.5 micrograms per deciliter (µg/dL). This reference level helps identify children with BLLs higher than most children's levels. CDC estimates that approximately 500,000 children in the United States have BLLs at or above the BLRV. Healthcare providers can use CDC's Recommended Actions Based on Blood Lead Level to develop a plan of action for their patient. More information about sources of exposure, risk factors, testing and prevention is provided below. Risk factors Some children are at a greater risk for lead exposure from paint, water, soil, some imported items and industrial sources. They may also be exposed through their parents and caregivers from certain jobs and hobbies. Keep Reading People at Increased Risk for Childhood Lead Poisoning Causes Children can be exposed to lead where they live, learn, and play. Sources of lead exposure can include the following: Chipping or peeling paint in homes or buildings built before 1978 Water from lead pipes Soil near airports, highways, or factories Some imported candies and traditional medicines Some imported toys and jewelry Certain jobs and hobbies Older homes and buildings may be painted with lead-based paint. Prevention The goal of CDC's Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program (CLPPP) is to prevent childhood lead exposure before any harm occurs. Through CLPPP, CDC supports state and local public health departments with funds for surveillance and prevention of lead exposure. Testing A blood lead test is the best way to determine if a child has been exposed to lead. Parents can talk to their healthcare provider to find out if a blood lead test is needed. Healthcare providers can recommend follow-up actions and care based on the child's BLL. To find out if a home has lead, hire a certified lead inspector to test for lead. Visit the Environmental Protection Agency's Lead Abatement, Inspection and Risk Assessment web page to locate one. Renters can ask their landlord to have the home inspected or to share results of recently conducted lead inspections.

Compared to children with healthy weight, children with obesity are at a higher risk for asthma, sleep apnea, bone and joint problems, type 2 diabetes, and other health issues. While there is no one solution, there are many ways parents and caregivers can help children have a healthy weight and set up lifelong healthy habits. Why it matters About 1 in 5 American children have obesity. Compared to children with healthy weight, children with obesity are at a higher risk for asthma, sleep apnea, bone and joint problems, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and mental health concerns like depression and anxiety. Children with obesity are more likely to have obesity as adults. Adults with obesity have higher risks for stroke, many types of cancer , heart disease, type 2 diabetes, premature death and mental health issues. Factors that influence obesity include genes, eating patterns, physical activity levels, access to health care, and sleep routines. Also, conditions where we live, learn, work, and play affect access to healthy food and safe places to be physically active. Though there is no one solution to addressing obesity, there are many ways parents and caregivers can help children have a healthy weight and set up lifelong healthy habits at home. Here are a few ways families can help prevent or address obesity. 1. Model a healthy eating pattern Offer a variety of fruits and vegetables throughout the day.

       " \"are a few ways families can help prevent or address obesity. 1. Model a healthy eating pattern Offer a variety of fruits and vegetables throughout the day. Frozen and canned fruits and vegetables are often less expensive than fresh and are still good for you. Look for low sodium or no salt added vegetables and fruits packed in water or 100% fruit juice. Adopting healthy eating patterns as a family can help children grow healthfully and maintain a healthy weight as they age. Eating a variety of vegetables and fruits, whole grains, lean protein foods, and dairy products that follow nutrition recommendations sets children and adults up for optimal health. Choose healthy drinks Help kids rethink their drink by replacing sugary drinks, such as soda, fruit drinks, and flavored milk, with water, 100% juice, or plain milk. Sugary drinks are the leading sources of added sugars in the American diet. Having too many sugary drinks can lead to weight gain, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and dental problems like cavities. The next time you go grocery shopping, read the nutrition labels on the items in your cart to see which ones have added sugars. You may be surprised to see the amount of added sugars in some drinks. Nutrition guidelines recommend that children younger than 2 years have zero foods or drinks with added sugars. From age 2 into adulthood, less than 10 percent of calories per day should come from added sugars. Keep Reading: Nutrition Facts Label and Your Health 2. Move more as a family Physically active youth have stronger muscles and bones, better cardiovascular fitness, and lower body fat than those who are inactive. Regular physical activity can also help improve attention and memory and reduce the risk of depression. Children aged 3–5 years should be physically active throughout the day. Guidelines recommend that children aged 6–17 years get at least 60 minutes of physical activity every day. Help your children move more and meet the physical activity recommendations by being active as a family. Walking the family pet before and after school, riding bikes, having races in the yard, all count toward physical activity. Active chores, such as washing the car, vacuuming a room, or raking leaves, also count. 3. Set simple routines for better sleep Getting enough sleep and healthy sleep patterns improve attention and behavior and can help to prevent type 2 diabetes, obesity, and injuries. Good sleep also helps improve mood and memory and is essential for our emotional well-being. Children who don't get enough sleep are at risk for unhealthy weight gain. Preschoolers need 10–13 hours of sleep per day , including naps. Children 6–12 years old need 9–12 hours of uninterrupted sleep a night, and youth 13–17 need 8–10 hours. Keeping a consistent sleep schedule, including on weekends, can help children sleep better . Keep Reading How Much Sleep Do I Need?

Fun family time can include walking outside, riding bikes, and having races in the yard. 4. Replace screen time with family time During childhood, too much screen time can lead to poor sleep, weight gain, lower grades in school , and poor mental health. Reducing screen time can free up time for family activities and can remove cues to eat unhealthy food. Turning off screens an hour before bed and removing screens from children's bedrooms can help reduce screen time and improve sleep. Parents can use this family media plan for examples of ways to reduce screen time. 5. Look for childcare that supports healthy habits The number of children in early care and education (ECE) settings makes childcare facilities among the best places outside the home to help young children build a foundation for healthy living. High-quality ECE programming can have a positive impact on a child's social-emotional wellbeing, educational achievement, health, and socioeconomic outcomes later in life. When looking for ECE programs for your child, ask about policies and practices related to nutrition and physical activity, like breastfeeding and feeding breast milk to infants, nutrition standards for the food served, access to outdoor physical activity , and daily screen time. 6. Find a family healthy weight program If you are concerned about your child's weight, talk with their health care provider. They can assess the health risks related to excess weight. If your child has overweight or obesity, your health care provider may refer you to a family healthy weight program (FHWP). These family-based lifestyle change programs help children and families make progress toward a healthier weight through positive behavior changes.

Chlorine has the following traits: Yellow-green gas under normal conditions Smells like bleach Dissolvable in water Liquid when pressurized and kept cool Chlorine is turned into a liquid for storage and transport. When liquid chlorine is released, it quickly turns into a gas that stays close to the ground and spreads quickly. Warning! Chlorine can explode or create explosive products with many common substances. They include: acetylene, ether, turpentine, ammonia, fuel gas, hydrogen, and finely divided metals. Signs and symptoms Most people will smell the chemical or feel irritation that tells you that you are exposed to chlorine. Exposure for a long time may affect people's ability to sense the chemical. Some people with asthma or other lung diseases may be more sensitive to breathing chlorine than others. Effects depend on how the person was exposed, how much they were exposed to, and how long they were exposed for. When chlorine gas touches moist tissues (like the eyes, throat, and lungs) it creates an acid that can hurt these tissues. If high amounts are breathed in, breathing problems may show up right away. Symptoms of exposure to higher levels of chlorine include the following: Blurred vision or eye tearing Burning feeling in the nose, throat, lungs, and eyes Coughing and/or coughing up white to pink-colored fluid Chest tightness Breathing problems, shortness of breath, or rapid and shallow breathing Respiratory failure (too much carbon dioxide in your body) Frostbite if exposed to liquid chlorine Nausea and/or vomiting Skin pain, redness, and/or blisters If low amounts are breathed in, symptoms may show up later. Exposure Warning! Household chlorine bleach can release chlorine\",\n",
       " 'shortness of breath, or rapid and shallow breathing Respiratory failure (too much carbon dioxide in your body) Frostbite if exposed to liquid chlorine Nausea and/or vomiting Skin pain, redness, and/or blisters If low amounts are breathed in, symptoms may show up later. Exposure Warning! Household chlorine bleach can release chlorine gas if it is mixed with certain other cleaning products. Do not mix household cleaners! If chlorine is in the air, people can be exposed through skin or eye contact, or breathing in the chlorine gas. If chlorine is in water, people can be exposed by touching or drinking water that contains chlorine. Because chlorine gas is heavier than air, it will sink to lower areas and increase the risk of exposure there. Chlorine in food Chlorine is unlikely to be eaten or drunk, because it has a very bad smell and taste. Do not use or eat food that smells, tastes, or looks unusual. Do not eat food that may have touched liquid chlorine if the food is not in a glass or metal container. If the food is in an unbroken sealed glass or metal container, it should not be affected by chlorine. Wash the outside of the container before using. Follow any directions by local authorities. What to do if you are exposed Get away Get away from the area where the chlorine was released and breathe fresh air. Outdoors If the chlorine release was outdoors, go indoors and shelter in place . Make sure windows are closed and ventilation systems are turned off to make sure the chlorine does not come inside. If you cannot go indoors, leave the area where the chlorine was released. Indoors If the chlorine release was indoors, get out of the building. If the chlorine release was from household cleaners or chemicals, open windows and doors to let in fresh air. Leave the area until the gas has gone away. If you cannot get away, go to the highest ground possible because chlorine is heavier than air and will sink. Get clean Get clean by taking off all clothes, jewelry, and accessories and showering as soon as you can. Showering is the best method for removing chlorine from your body. If you cannot take off all layers, take off as many clothes as you can. Take your clothes off If clothes are frozen to your body, do not try to remove until no longer frozen. Instead, begin washing with a lot of lukewarm water. Then remove your clothes. Do not pull clothing over your head. If you must pull clothing over your head, close your eyes and mouth, and hold your breath. This will stop the chlorine from getting in your eyes, nose, or mouth. Put clothes in a plastic bag. Drop clothes to the floor. If you wear contact lenses, take them out and place them with your clothing. Do not put contact lenses back in. Wash your body Wash your hair, face, and hands, and then wash the rest',\n",

Do not put contact lenses back in. Wash your body Wash your hair, face, and hands, and then wash the rest of your body. Wash from your head to your feet, including armpits and groin, with lots of lukewarm water and mild soap for several minutes. Finish with a plain water rinse. Try not to let the water run into your eyes, nose, or mouth. Do not scrub! If your eyes are burning or you can't see normally, wash your eyes for 10–15 minutes with lukewarm water. Do not use eye drops. Dry your face, then tilt your head back and dry your hair, and then dry down your body. Use anything that will soak up water. Drop used things to the floor. Dress in any available clean clothes to prevent hypothermia (low body temperature). This is especially important if temperatures are cool. Clear the dirty items If emergency response services are available, leave used items on the floor and report where they are to emergency teams. Move as far from the used items as possible. Otherwise, put on waterproof or heavy gloves that won't let liquid through. Gather all used things from the floor and put them in a plastic bag, close it up, and place it in a second plastic bag. Close up the second bag also. Do not put the bags in the regular trash! Place the bags in an area where other people are unlikely to disturb them and touch chlorine. Inform local authorities of the location of the bags for pick up. Get help Get help right away by calling 911, going to the hospital if local officials say it is safe to leave your home, or calling the Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222. Treatment If someone has swallowed chlorine, do not force vomiting. No known cure exists for chlorine exposure. Treatment involves removing chlorine from the body as soon as possible and providing supportive medical care. Symptoms can be treated in a hospital setting or by trained emergency personnel. Long-term health effects Short exposure Lung health usually returns to normal within 7 to 14 days. Although most people recover completely, symptoms and lung issues may continue for those more seriously exposed. Exposure to chlorine can lead to reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS), asthma caused by chemicals. Long term exposure This often occurs in the workplace. Teeth may be weakened. Multiple exposures to chlorine may also produce flu-like symptoms and high risk of RADS.

Signs and symptoms depend on how much you were exposed to, how you were exposed, and for how long. If you were exposed, get clean and get medical care. Background Riot control agents (also called \"tear gas\") are chemical compounds that temporarily make people unable to function. It does this by causing irritation to the eyes, mouth, throat, lungs, and skin. Several different compounds are riot control agents: Chloroacetophenone (CN) Chlorobenzylidenemalononitrile (CS) Chloropicrin (PS) - also used as a fumigant Bromobenzylcyanide (CA) Dibenzoxazepine (CR) Combinations of various agents. Where it is found Riot control agents are used by law enforcement officials for crowd control. It is also used by individuals and the general public for personal protection (for example, pepper spray). CS is also used in military settings to test the speed and ability of military personnel to use their gas masks. How it works Riot control agents work by causing irritation to the area of contact (for example, eyes, skin, nose) within seconds of exposure. The effects usually only last 15 to 30 minutes after the person is away from the source and cleaned off. Signs and symptoms The level of poisoning depends on the amount someone was exposed to, how the person was exposed, and for how long. It also depends on the location of exposure (indoors versus outdoors). People exposed to riot control agents may experience some or all of the following symptoms immediately after exposure: Eyes: excessive tearing, burning, blurred vision, redness Nose: runny nose, burning, swelling Mouth: burning, irritation, difficulty swallowing, drooling Lungs: chest tightness, coughing, choking sensation, noisy breathing (wheezing), shortness of breath Skin: burns, rash Other: nausea and vomiting Long lasting exposure or exposure to a large dose may cause severe effects such as: Blindness Glaucoma - a serious eye condition that can lead to blindess Immediate death due to',\n",

Exposure Riot control agents such as CN and CS are liquids or solids (for example, powders). Therefore, they could be released in the air as fine droplets or particles. If agents are released into the air, people could be exposed through skin contact, eye contact, or breathing them in. What to do if you are exposed Since breathing in riot control agents is the primary way of exposure, leave the area and get fresh air. Quickly moving to an area where fresh air is available is highly effective in reducing exposure to riot control agents. If the riot control agents were released outdoors, move away from the area where the agents were released. Stay away from dense, low-lying clouds of riot control agent vapor. Go to the highest ground possible. Riot control agents will form a dense vapor cloud that can travel close to the ground. If the riot control agents were released indoors, get out of the building. Evacuate or \"shelter in place\" If you are near a release, emergency teams may tell you to evacuate the area or \" shelter in place \" inside. If you think you were exposed\\u200e Take your clothes off, wash your body, and get medical care as quickly as possible. Dial 911 and explain what has happened. Take off your clothes Remove the clothing as quickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of pulling it over the head. If you are helping others, do not touch unsafe areas. Wash your body Wash any riot control agents from your skin with lots of soap and water. Washing with soap and water will protect you from any chemicals on your body. If your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes. If you wear contacts, remove them and put them with the dirty clothing. Do not put the contacts back in your eyes (even if they are not disposable contacts). If you wear eyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. You can put your eyeglasses back on after you wash them. Throw your clothes away After you have washed yourself, place your clothing inside a plastic bag. Avoid touching unsafe areas of the clothing. If you can\\'t avoid touching unsafe areas, or you aren\\'t sure where the unsafe areas are, wear rubber gloves. You can also use tongs, tool handles, sticks, or similar objects to put the clothing in the bag. Anything that touches the dirty clothing should also be placed',\n",

If you wear contacts, put them in the plastic bag, too. Seal or tie the bag, and then put that bag inside another plastic bag. Throwing away your clothes this way helps protect you and others from any chemicals that might be on your clothes. When the local or state health department or emergency team arrive, tell them what you did with your clothes. The health department or emergency team will arrange for further disposal. Do not handle the plastic bags yourself. Keep Reading: About Getting Clean Treatment Treatment involves helping the affected person get more oxygen in his or her blood and stopping chemical burns from getting worse. Medications that are used to treat asthma (such as bronchodilators and steroids) may also be used to help the person breathe. Treating eye exposures involves rinsing the eyes with water until there is no sign of riot control agents in the eyes. Burn injuries to the skin are treated with standard burn management techniques, including use of medicated bandages. No antidote exists for poisoning from riot control agents. Long-term health effects Long-lasting exposure or exposure to a large amount of riot control agent may cause severe effects such as the following: Glaucoma (a serious eye condition that can lead to blindness) Eye scarring Cataracts Breathing problems, such as asthma These effects are more likely if someone was expsoed in a closed setting, such as indoors. If symptoms go away soon after a person is no longer exposed, long-term health effects are unlikely to happen.

Exposure Riot control agents such as CN and CS are liquids or solids (for example, powders). Therefore, they could be released in the air as fine droplets or particles. If agents are released into the air, people could be exposed through skin contact, eye contact, or breathing them in. What to do if you are exposed Since breathing in riot control agents is the primary way of exposure, leave the area and get fresh air. Quickly moving to an area where fresh air is available is highly effective in reducing exposure to riot control agents. If the riot control agents were released outdoors, move away from the area where the agents were released. Stay away from dense, low-lying clouds of riot control agent vapor. Go to the highest ground possible. Riot control agents will form a dense vapor cloud that can travel close to the ground. If the riot control agents were released indoors, get out of the building. Evacuate or \"shelter in place\" If you are near a release, emergency teams may tell you to evacuate the area or \" shelter in place \" inside. If you think you were exposed\\u200e Take your clothes off, wash your body, and get medical care as quickly as possible. Dial 911 and explain what has happened. Take off your clothes Remove the clothing as quickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of pulling it over the head. If you are helping others, do not touch unsafe areas. Wash your body Wash any riot control agents from your skin with lots of soap and water. Washing with soap and water will protect you from any chemicals on your body. If your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes. If you wear contacts, remove them and put them with the dirty clothing. Do not put the contacts back in your eyes (even if they are not disposable contacts). If you wear eyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. You can put your eyeglasses back on after you wash them. Throw your clothes away After you have washed yourself, place your clothing inside a plastic bag. Avoid touching unsafe areas of the clothing. If you can\\'t avoid touching unsafe areas, or you aren\\'t sure where the unsafe areas are, wear rubber gloves. You can also use tongs, tool handles, sticks, or similar objects to put the clothing in the bag. Anything that touches the dirty clothing should also be placed',\n",

If you wear contacts, put them in the plastic bag, too. Seal or tie the bag, and then put that bag inside another plastic bag. Throwing away your clothes this way helps protect you and others from any chemicals that might be on your clothes. When the local or state health department or emergency team arrive, tell them what you did with your clothes. The health department or emergency team will arrange for further disposal. Do not handle the plastic bags yourself. Keep Reading: About Getting Clean Treatment Treatment involves helping the affected person get more oxygen in his or her blood and stopping chemical burns from getting worse. Medications that are used to treat asthma (such as bronchodilators and steroids) may also be used to help the person breathe. Treating eye exposures involves rinsing the eyes with water until there is no sign of riot control agents in the eyes. Burn injuries to the skin are treated with standard burn management techniques, including use of medicated bandages. No antidote exists for poisoning from riot control agents. Long-term health effects Long-lasting exposure or exposure to a large amount of riot control agent may cause severe effects such as the following: Glaucoma (a serious eye condition that can lead to blindness) Eye scarring Cataracts Breathing problems, such as asthma These effects are more likely if someone was expsoed in a closed setting, such as indoors. If symptoms go away soon after a person is no longer exposed, long-term health effects are unlikely to happen.

Cholera can cause severe diarrhea, dehydration, and even death if the disease goes untreated. People living in places with unsafe drinking water, poor sanitation, and inadequate hygiene are at highest risk of cholera. What it is Cholera is an infection of the intestines caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae . You can get cholera from drinking water or eating food containing cholera bacteria. Most people who get cholera don't get sick. However, cholera can cause life-threatening watery diarrhea and vomiting. Every year, an estimated 1.3 to 4 million people around the world get cholera, and between 21,000 to 143,000 people die. With early and proper treatment, even severely ill patients can survive cholera. Signs and symptoms Most people who get cholera have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. About 1 in 10 people develop severe symptoms such as watery diarrhea, vomiting, and leg cramps. Losing body fluids quickly can lead to dehydration and shock. Keep Reading: Signs and Symptoms of Cholera Who is at risk People living in areas with unsafe drinking water, poor sanitation, and inadequate hygiene are at highest risk of getting cholera. U.S. residents can get cholera while traveling abroad and sometimes become ill after returning home. Some travelers have gotten sick after bringing contaminated seafood home with them from abroad. Keep Reading: About Cholera in the United States How it spreads People usually get cholera from drinking water or eating food that contains traces of poop from someone with cholera.

It makes physical and mental exertion difficult. Symptoms include trouble thinking, severe tiredness and other symptoms. There is no known cause or cure. Care usually means treating the symptoms that most affect a person's life. Overview ME/CFS is a biological illness that affects many body parts. It causes severe fatigue not improved by rest, problems thinking and sleeping, dizziness, pain, and many other symptoms. People with ME/CFS may not look sick but can't do their normal activities. ME/CFS may get worse after they do any activity -- physical or mental. This symptom is called post-exertional malaise (PEM). After they exert themselves, they may need to stay in bed for an extended time. About 1 in 4 people with ME/CFS are confined to bed at some point in their illness. Did you know?\\u200e It's estimated that up to 3.3 million people in the United States suffer from ME/CFS. More than 9 in 10 people with ME/CFS have not been diagnosed by a doctor. ME/CFS costs the U.S. economy about $18 to $51 billion annually in medical costs and lost income. It is difficult to diagnose because there is no specific test for ME/CFS. One reason that people with ME/CFS have not been diagnosed may be limited access to healthcare. Another reason may be a lack of healthcare providers who know about ME/CFS and how to recognize it. Anyone can get ME/CFS. It doesn't matter what age, gender or ethnicity they\",\n",
       " \"test for ME/CFS. One reason that people with ME/CFS have not been diagnosed may be limited access to healthcare. Another reason may be a lack of healthcare providers who know about ME/CFS and how to recognize it. Anyone can get ME/CFS. It doesn't matter what age, gender or ethnicity they are. However, some groups are more affected than others. Signs and symptoms People with ME/CFS are not able to function the same way they did before they became ill. They may not always be able to do daily tasks like showering or cooking a meal. ME/CFS often makes it hard to keep a job, go to school, and take part in family and social life. ME/CFS can last for years and sometimes leads to serious disability. ME/CFS is most common in people in middle age but also affects kids, teens and elderly people. Among adults, women are affected more often than men. Among children, teens are more affected than younger kids. People who are white are diagnosed more often than other races and ethnicities. But many people with ME/CFS have not been diagnosed, especially among people from racial and ethnic minority groups. Diagnosis Symptoms of ME/CFS may appear similar to many other illnesses. There is no test to confirm ME/CFS. This makes it difficult to diagnose. The illness can also be unpredictable. Symptoms may come and go, or there may be changes in how severe symptoms are over time. A doctor should be able to distinguish ME/CFS from other illnesses by doing a thorough medical exam. This includes asking many questions about the patient's health history and current illness. They should also ask about how often symptoms occur, how bad they are, and how long they have lasted. It is also important for doctors to talk with patients about how the symptoms affect their lives. Treatment and recovery There is no cure or approved treatment for ME/CFS. But some symptoms can be treated or managed. Treating these symptoms might provide relief for some people with ME/CFS but not others. Other strategies, like learning new ways to manage activity, can also help. People with ME/CFS, their families, and healthcare providers need to work together to decide which symptom causes the most problems. This should be treated first after discussing possible benefits and harms of any treatment plans, including medicines and other therapies. Healthcare providers need to support their patients' families as they come to understand how to live with this illness. Providers and families should remember that this process is likely to be hard on people with ME/CFS.

It is a leading cause of death in the United States. Smoking is the main cause of COPD, but nonsmokers can get it. Talk with your doctor if you have COPD symptoms or previously smoked. What it is COPD is a group of lung diseases that get worse over time. The most common COPD types are emphysema and chronic bronchitis . There is no cure for COPD, but it can be treated. Nearly 16 million U.S. adults have COPD, 1 and many more do not know they have it. 2 Symptoms Common signs and symptoms include: Frequent coughing or wheezing. Shortness of breath doing everyday activities. Trouble taking deep breaths. Excess phlegm or mucus. Complications COPD is 1 of the top 10 causes of death in the U.S. 3 4 People with COPD are more likely to have difficulty: 1 Working or doing usual activities. Walking or climbing stairs. Concentrating, remembering, or making decisions. They are also more likely to have: Other chronic diseases like asthma, heart disease, and diabetes. Depression or mental health condition. Reported poor health. Causes and risk factors Tobacco smoke is the main cause of COPD in the United States. 5 Risk factors Anyone who smokes or used to smoke cigarettes has a higher risk of developing COPD. Other risk factors include: Secondhand smoke. Exposure to environmental or workplace breathing hazards. Family history of COPD. Asthma. Reducing risk To lower your risk of COPD: Stop smoking. Avoid inhaling cigarette smoke. Limit time in places with bad air quality. Who is at risk Some people are more likely to have COPD, including: 1 6 7 Current or former smokers. People with a history of asthma. Women. Adults 65 and older. American Indian or Alaska Native populations and people of more than one race.

       " 'People with a history of asthma. Women. Adults 65 and older. American Indian or Alaska Native populations and people of more than one race. People who are unemployed, unable to work, retired, a homemaker or a student. People with less than a high school education. Diagnosis If you have any COPD symptoms, talk to your doctor. Getting diagnosed early allows you to manage and treat COPD, so you can prevent it from getting worse. Getting tested Doctors can use a common test to help detect COPD. The spironmetry test looks at how well your lungs work. It measures how much air you can breathe in and force out. Treatment and management There is no cure for COPD, but there are steps you can take. Lifestyle changes and treatments can help reduce your symptoms and improve your quality of life. Lifestyle changes Quit smoking—For smokers with COPD, the most important part of treatment is to stop smoking. Pulmonary rehabilitation programs—These personalized programs teach you how to manage your COPD symptoms. You may learn how to: Breathe better. Conserve your energy. Choose what types of food and physical activities are right for you. Treatment options Medication—Symptoms like coughing or wheezing can be treated with different medicines. Respiratory infections can be treated with antibiotics. This will help prevent serious problems that could develop. Vaccinations—Lung infections can cause serious problems for people with COPD. Respiratory disease vaccines can help prevent illness. These vaccines include: COVID-19. Flu (influenza). Pneumococcal. Oxygen therapy—Portable oxygen can help you breathe easier if your blood oxygen levels are low.

Symptoms can follow many different types of infections. It is important to discuss your symptoms and concerns with your doctor to develop a personalized treatment or care plan. Overview Infections can sometimes leave people with symptoms that last for weeks to months or longer, even after appropriate treatment. Some of these symptoms are well-recognized and specific to the type of infection, such as loss of smell and COVID-19. Sometimes, people experience groups of symptoms that affect a certain area of the body. For example, people might have chronic stomach pain, diarrhea, and bloating following an infection of the gastrointestinal tract. Other times, people could have symptoms that are unexplained and general, like fatigue or difficulty thinking. Similar symptoms can follow many different types of infections. Some infections that have been linked to chronic symptoms (In alphabetical order) Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease) Campylobacter Chikungunya virus Coccidioidomycosis (Valley Fever) Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) Dengue virus Ebola virus Epstein Barr virus (infectious mononucleosis) Enterovirus Giardia Poliovirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) West Nile virus Some people with chronic symptoms following infections may not know which infection triggered the symptoms, or even recognize that they had an infection before their chronic symptoms began. Some people with chronic symptoms and unknown preceding infection may be diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome . How it affects your body General symptoms can include: Tiredness or fatigue that interferes with daily life General feelings of sickness, including muscle pain, headache, sweating, and irritability Symptoms that get worse after physical or mental effort (also known as \"post-exertional malaise\") Difficulty thinking or concentrating (sometimes referred to as \"brain fog\"), trouble finding words Chronic or recurrent joint pain Sleep problems Causes It is not fully known why some people experience chronic general symptoms.

Keep Reading What Causes Chronic Symptoms Following Infections Living with chronic symptoms The type, duration, and intensity of chronic symptoms following an infection can be different from person to person. Symptoms may come and go or vary in severity (how bad the person feels over time). Some patients’ symptoms slowly improve with time. However, it can take weeks and sometimes years to feel well. The longer fatigue or other symptoms last, the more likely they are to lead to other problems, such as physical weakness or difficulty with performing daily activities. Long-term illnesses can also impact relationships and a person’s mental health. It is important to talk to a healthcare provider if you are concerned about any symptoms that last a long time. Keep Reading Talking with a Healthcare Provider about Chronic Symptoms Treatment and recovery In many cases, there are no specific treatments or cures for chronic symptoms following an infection. There are, however, steps you can take to reduce the impact these symptoms have on your life. Given the overlap in symptoms, management and treatment approaches for people with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome ( ME/CFS ) can be helpful for people experiencing general chronic symptoms. More information on how to treat chronic symptoms following a specific infection may be available at the above disease websites. What CDC is doing By looking across the infections known to cause chronic symptoms, public health professionals can learn more about how often and why they occur, as well as how to diagnose and treat them. This year, CDC is: Funding studies to learn more about how to recognize and treat patients who experience chronic symptoms after an infection Meeting with experts to prioritize research activities and improve guidance for clinicians Increasing awareness among healthcare providers and the public by developing and sharing trainings, toolkits, and other educational products for healthcare providers and patients Monitoring the occurrence of chronic symptoms following certain infections Working with patient partner organizations to understand the needs and priorities of people with chronic symptoms following infection Resources For more information on this topic: Unexplained post-acute infection syndromes, Nature Medicine Long COVID or Post-COVID Conditions Information for Healthcare Providers on ME/CFS Living with ME/CFS On This Page Overview How it affects your body Causes Living with chronic symptoms Treatment and recovery What CDC is doing Resources Nov. 24, 2025 Sources Print Share Facebook LinkedIn Twitter Syndicate Content Source: National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID) Chronic Symptoms Following Infections Chronic symptoms can follow many different types of infections.

What it is A TBI affects how the brain works Doctor examines a brain using modern technology. A traumatic brain injury, or TBI, is an injury that affects how the brain works. It may be caused by a: Bump, blow, or jolt to the head, or Penetrating injury (such as from a gunshot ) to the head There are three main types of TBI: Mild TBI or concussion Moderate TBI Severe TBI TBI is a major cause of death and disability There were over 69,000 TBI-related deaths in the United States in 2021. 1 That's about 190 TBI-related deaths every day. TBIs affect the lives of people of all ages. Anyone can experience a TBI, but data suggest that some groups are at greater risk of dying from a TBI or experiencing long-term health problems after the injury. 2 Examples of groups who are more likely to be affected by TBI, include: Racial and ethnic minorities 3 Service members and veterans 4 People who experience homelessness 5 People who are in correctional and detention facilities 6 Survivors of intimate partner violence 7 People living in rural areas 8 Learn more about health disparities and TBI .

How TBIs happen People most commonly get TBIs from a fall, firearm-related injury, motor vehicle crash, or an assault. Research shows that: Falls lead to nearly half of the TBI-related hospitalizations. 9 Firearm-related suicide is the most common cause of TBI-related deaths in the United States. 3 10 Motor vehicle crashes and assaults are other common ways a person may get a TBI. 9 For more detailed information on the leading ways people get TBIs and the groups of people most likely to get a TBI, check out CDC's TBI data reports . Populations TBIs may be missed in older adults Older adults are more likely to be hospitalized and die from a TBI compared to all other age groups. 9 Still, TBIs may be missed or misdiagnosed in older adults because symptoms of TBI overlap with other medical conditions that are more common among older adults, such as dementia. Healthcare providers should check for signs and symptoms of TBI if an older adult has: Fallen or has a fall-related injury, such as a hip fracture. Been in a car crash. This is especially important among older adults who are taking blood thinners, 11 such as: Anticoagulants like warfarin (Coumadin), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), and apixaban (Eliquis). Antiplatelet medications like clopidogrel (Plavix), ticagrelor (Brilinta), and acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin). These medicines may increase the risk for bleeding in the brain following a TBI. 11 Bleeding in the brain after a TBI may put a person at risk for more severe injury or death. Potential effects of TBIs A TBI may lead to short- or long-term health problems Depending on the severity of the injury, those who get a TBI may face health problems that last a few days or the rest of their lives. For example, a person with a mild TBI or concussion may experience short-term symptoms and feel better within a couple of weeks or months. And a person with a moderate or severe TBI may have long-term or life-long effects from the injury. A person with a possible TBI should be seen by a healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider may have treatment to help speed your recovery. Most people with a mild TBI or concussion can recover safely at home following a medical check-up. People with a moderate or severe TBI may need ongoing care, such as rehabilitation services, to help with their recovery. A TBI during childhood may affect brain development TBI affects children differently than adults. An injury of any severity to the developing brain may: Disrupt a child's development. Limit their ability to participate in school and other activities, like sports.

The disease hasn\\'t been shown to infect people. Scientists continue to study whether having contact with or eating meat from infected animals could affect people. Overview Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a prion disease that affects deer, elk, moose and similar animals. It has been reported in the United States, Canada, Norway, Finland, Sweden and South Korea. CWD infections in people have never been reported, and so far, it\\'s not known if people could get infected with CWD. However, another prion disease in animals, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or \"mad cow\" disease) can cause a disease in people called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease . Also, some studies in monkeys suggest they could get CWD by eating meat or brain tissues of infected deer or elk, so, in theory, CWD could be considered a risk to people. Scientists continue to look into this possibility. If CWD could spread to people, it would most likely be by eating meat from an infected animal. A CDC survey of U.S. residents showed nearly 1 in 5 said they had hunted deer or elk. More than 6 in 10 said they had eaten venison or elk meat. These groups would likely be most at risk if CWD spreads to people. Causes Chronic wasting disease is a type of prion disease. In rare cases, prion proteins that are normally found in the body misfold, causing serious symptoms in the animal or person affected. This illness eventually leads to death. Scientists believe CWD prions spread between animals through body fluids like feces, saliva, blood, or urine.

Once the disease is established in an area, the CWD prions can stay in the soil for years. If you're hunting in areas with CWD activity, follow these steps to reduce your risk of contact with the disease: Do not shoot, handle or eat animals that look sick or act strangely. Do not touch or eat meat from animals found dead. If you're field-dressing a deer or handling meat: Wear latex or rubber gloves Avoid handling its internal organs, especially the brain or spine. Do not use knives or other tools you use in your kitchen. Check state wildlife and health department recommendations before you hunt. See if they recommend or require testing animals for CWD in the hunting area. Recommendations vary by state. Strongly consider having the deer or elk tested for CWD before you eat the meat. If your deer is processed commercially, consider asking to have your animal be processed individually. This ensures you are only getting meat from your animal. If your animal tests positive for CWD, do not eat meat from that animal. What CDC is doing CDC has been working with health officials in states where CWD has been reported for decades. We are collaborating to watch for potential CWD cases in people. By surveying hunters' health in states with long CWD histories, we hope to have early warnings if it spreads to people.

The disease hasn\\'t been shown to infect people. Scientists continue to study whether having contact with or eating meat from infected animals could affect people. Overview Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a prion disease that affects deer, elk, moose and similar animals. It has been reported in the United States, Canada, Norway, Finland, Sweden and South Korea. CWD infections in people have never been reported, and so far, it\\'s not known if people could get infected with CWD. However, another prion disease in animals, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or \"mad cow\" disease) can cause a disease in people called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease . Also, some studies in monkeys suggest they could get CWD by eating meat or brain tissues of infected deer or elk, so, in theory, CWD could be considered a risk to people. Scientists continue to look into this possibility. If CWD could spread to people, it would most likely be by eating meat from an infected animal. A CDC survey of U.S. residents showed nearly 1 in 5 said they had hunted deer or elk. More than 6 in 10 said they had eaten venison or elk meat.

Going in or near water with a harmful algal bloom can make you and your animals sick. Stay out if water looks discolored, has scum, or smells bad. Overview Algae and cyanobacteria (also called blue-green algae) are plant-like organisms that live in water. They can quickly grow out of control, or \"bloom.\" Some of these blooms produce toxins (poisons) that make people and animals sick. What they look like Harmful algal blooms can look like foam, scum, mats, or paint on the surface of the water. They can also grow underneath the water, making some harmful algal blooms hard to see. A bloom can change the color of the water—for example to green, blue, brown, or red. Keep Reading How to Recognize a Harmful Algal Bloom When they\\'re harmful Not all blooms are harmful. Blooms of algae or cyanobacteria can harm people, animals, or the environment if they: Make toxins Become too dense Use up oxygen in the water Release harmful gases Types Many different types of algae can cause harmful algal blooms. However, three types —cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates, and diatoms—cause most blooms that make people and animals sick. Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) are the most common cause of harmful algal blooms in fresh water, such as lakes or rivers.

Bites can cause itching, loss of sleep, and, rarely, allergic reactions. Prevent bed bugs by regularly looking for signs of infestation. More Information For Everyone Health Care Providers Overview Bed bugs ( Cimex species ) are small, flat insects. Bed bugs bite people and animals at night while they sleep, feeding on their blood. Bed bugs are reddish-brown in color, are wingless, and range from 1mm to 7mm in size (roughly the size of Lincoln's head on a penny). They can live several months without a blood meal. Bed bugs are not known to spread diseases to people. However, they cause irritation, itching, and loss off sleep. Removal from dwellings can be expensive and inconvenient to remove. Where you can find bed bugs You can find bed bugs anywhere, from North and South America, to Africa, Asia, and Europe. Bed bugs are in five-star hotels and resorts. How clean a place is does not determine whether bed bugs are present. Signs and symptoms Although bed bugs are not known to spread diseases to people, they can cause itching and loss of sleep. Sometimes intense itching can lead to excessive scratching and possibly a secondary skin infection. An allergic reaction to several bites is possible. If you think you are having an allergic reaction to bed bug bites, speak with your healthcare provider. How to tell if you've been bitten Bed bug bites affect each person differently. Signs of a bed bug bites include No physical signs Small bite marks Serious allergic reactions (rare). When bed bugs bite, they inject fluids (anesthetic and anticoagulant) that prevents a person from feeling the bite when it happens. Most people do not notice the bite marks until they appear from one to several days after the initial bite. Bites look similar to mosquito or flea bites—a slightly swollen and red area that may itch and be irritating. The bite marks may be random or appear in a straight line. Other symptoms of bed bug bites include insomnia, anxiety, and skin problems that arise from intense scratching of the bites. Allergic reactions are possible Allergic symptoms can include enlarged\",\n",

Other symptoms of bed bug bites include insomnia, anxiety, and skin problems that arise from intense scratching of the bites. Allergic reactions are possible Allergic symptoms can include enlarged bite marks, painful swellings at the bite site, and, on rare occasions, anaphylaxis. If you think you are having an allergic reaction to bed bug bites, speak with your healthcare provider. Exposure risks Everyone is at risk for getting bed bugs when visiting an infested area. However, you are at higher risk of getting bed bugs if you travel frequently and share living and sleeping space where other people have previously slept. Causes and spread Bed bugs are experts at hiding. Their slim flat bodies allow them to fit into very small spaces. They can go long periods of time without a blood meal. Bed bugs spread by getting into the seams and folds of luggage, overnight bags, folded clothes, bedding, furniture, and anywhere else they can hide. Most people do not realize they are transporting bed bugs and infecting areas as they travel. Resource\\u200e DPDx - Bed Bug life cycle Reducing risk Early detection and eradication of bed bugs can make infestations easier to control. For those that travel, it may be helpful to look for signs of infestation, such as exoskeletons or bed bugs in folds of mattresses and sheets, in sleeping areas. Where to look for bed bugs Bed bug infestations usually happen around or near areas where people sleep. This includes apartments, shelters, houses, hotels, cruise ships, buses, trains, and dorm rooms. The bugs hide during the day in places on or around the bed. They can hide in The seams of mattresses Box springs Bed frames and headboards Dresser tables Inside cracks or crevices Behind wallpaper Bed bugs can travel over 100 feet in a night but tend to live within 8 feet of where people sleep. Signs of an infestation One of the easiest ways to identify a bed bug infestation is by bite marks on the face, neck, arms, hands, or any other body parts after sleeping. However, these bite marks may take as long as 14 days to develop in some people. It's important to look for other clues to determine if you have an infestation. Look for Exoskeletons (shed after molting), Bed bugs in the fold of mattresses and sheets, Rusty–colored blood spots on mattresses or nearby furniture, and A sweet musty odor. Treatment Treating bites Bed bug bites can cause inflammatory reactions in some people, but usually do not require medical treatment. The best way to treat a bite is to apply antiseptic creams or lotions to help with itching and to avoid scratching the area (to prevent secondary infections). For people with itchy inflammatory reactions, an antihistamine may help control the itching.

It affects the brain and causes dementia and other problems, mostly in older adults. There is no treatment or cure. Overview CJD is caused by a prion. Prion proteins are normally found in the body. In rare cases, these proteins misfold and pile up in the brain, leading to CJD. CJD causes dementia and other neurologic problems. Once symptoms begin, it can lead to death in months to a year. Classic CJD occurs worldwide in older adults, with the average age in the late 60s. Very few cases occur in people who are younger than 30 years old. CJD occurs with an estimated rate of about 1 to 2 deaths per 1 million people per year. In the United States, about 500-600 cases are reported each year. Types There are three main types of CJD infection: Sporadic The vast majority of all CJD cases reported (about 85%) are called sporadic. These types of cases occur when prion proteins already in the body misfold for reasons that aren\\'t fully understood. This breaks down the brain\\'s functions. Familial About 5-15% of CJD cases occur because the person has inherited a mutation in the prion protein gene. A person with CJD with a parent, sibling, or child who also has the disease likely has \"familial CJD.\" Iatrogenic Iatrogenic cases are caused by contact with prions in a healthcare setting or from biological products. There have been 6 known CJD cases caused by surgical or medical equipment contaminated with prions from another patient with the disease. This has not been reported since 1976 due to changes in procedures to decontaminate the equipment. People who received prion-contaminated human growth hormone before 1978 may also develop iatrogenic CJD. Even 50 years later, cases are still being identified. Finally, cases have occurred in people who received dura mater (a membrane in the brain and spinal cord) grafts and corneal (eye) transplants. If the donor had CJD that was not found before the donation, recipients can get CJD. How it affects your body People with CJD suffer from dementia.

How it affects your body People with CJD suffer from dementia. Other symptoms may include trouble walking, sudden jerky movements, and visual disturbances. CJD patients usually die within 1 year after symptoms start. Testing and diagnosis Healthcare providers can diagnose an illness as a suspect case based on: Symptoms and course of illness Tests of a person\\'s spinal fluid Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), a brain scan EEG, a test of electrical activity in the brain The only way to confirm CJD is through testing brain tissue from a biopsy or an autopsy. Treatment There is unfortunately no therapy that will slow or stop the disease from getting worse. Treatment involves supportive care to make the patient more comfortable. Similar diseases Though they have very similar names, CJD and variant CJD (vCJD) are not the same disease. Both are prion diseases. However, variant CJD is tied to eating meat from cows infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (sometimes called Mad Cow Disease). CJD, sometimes called \"classic CJD\" to avoid confusion, mostly occurs with no known cause. Unlike variant CJD, classic CJD is not caused by any other prion disease.

It affects the brain and causes dementia and other problems, mostly in older adults. There is no treatment or cure. Overview CJD is caused by a prion. Prion proteins are normally found in the body. In rare cases, these proteins misfold and pile up in the brain, leading to CJD. CJD causes dementia and other neurologic problems. Once symptoms begin, it can lead to death in months to a year. Classic CJD occurs worldwide in older adults, with the average age in the late 60s. Very few cases occur in people who are younger than 30 years old. CJD occurs with an estimated rate of about 1 to 2 deaths per 1 million people per year. In the United States, about 500-600 cases are reported each year. Types There are three main types of CJD infection: Sporadic The vast majority of all CJD cases reported (about 85%) are called sporadic. These types of cases occur when prion proteins already in the body misfold for reasons that aren\\'t fully understood. This breaks down the brain\\'s functions. Familial About 5-15% of CJD cases occur because the person has inherited a mutation in the prion protein gene. A person with CJD with a parent, sibling, or child who also has the disease likely has \"familial CJD.\" Iatrogenic Iatrogenic cases are caused by contact with prions in a healthcare setting or from biological products. There have been 6 known CJD cases caused by surgical or medical equipment contaminated with prions from another patient with the disease. This has not been reported since 1976 due to changes in procedures to decontaminate the equipment. People who received prion-contaminated human growth hormone before 1978 may also develop iatrogenic CJD. Even 50 years later, cases are still being identified. Finally, cases have occurred in people who received dura mater (a membrane in the brain and spinal cord) grafts and corneal (eye) transplants. If the donor had CJD that was not found before the donation, recipients can get CJD. How it affects your body People with CJD suffer from dementia.

How it affects your body People with CJD suffer from dementia. Other symptoms may include trouble walking, sudden jerky movements, and visual disturbances. CJD patients usually die within 1 year after symptoms start. Testing and diagnosis Healthcare providers can diagnose an illness as a suspect case based on: Symptoms and course of illness Tests of a person\\'s spinal fluid Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), a brain scan EEG, a test of electrical activity in the brain The only way to confirm CJD is through testing brain tissue from a biopsy or an autopsy. Treatment There is unfortunately no therapy that will slow or stop the disease from getting worse. Treatment involves supportive care to make the patient more comfortable. Similar diseases Though they have very similar names, CJD and variant CJD (vCJD) are not the same disease. Both are prion diseases. However, variant CJD is tied to eating meat from cows infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (sometimes called Mad Cow Disease). CJD, sometimes called \"classic CJD\" to avoid confusion, mostly occurs with no known cause. Unlike variant CJD, classic CJD is not caused by any other prion disease.

Disclaimer Advice from CDC and CISA is meant to assist in decision-making rather than to provide direct patient management. Patient management decisions are the responsibility of the treating healthcare provider. CISA may require up to three months to collect and review all pertinent medical records, review the medical literature, review vaccine safety surveillance reports for similar reports of adverse events, and discuss the case on a clinical consultation call with CISA members and the patient's healthcare provider. Consultation process Provider submits their free clinical consultation request. CDC or CISA staff will contact you if more information is required. The CDC CISA Team reviews and sends select inquiries to the CISA project sites for in-depth evaluation. If not sent for evaluation, the CDC CISA Team addresses the question or defers to another channel for a response. CISA notifies provider if they will review their case (within 1–2 weeks after submission of request). CISA meets to conduct clinical case evaluation. Often, the requesting healthcare provider attends and participates in the discussion. During each case's evaluation, an investigator presents: The clinical case, including the history of present illness (the adverse event following vaccination). Detailed physical examination and diagnostic (laboratory and other) findings. A summary of literature related to the condition and other vaccine safety data, such as from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) . Experts discuss the findings and form a general assessment and plan. CISA shares conclusions with the healthcare provider. Usually, CISA investigators and CDC have no direct contact with the patient. Keep in mind If you are not a healthcare provider or health department staff member and have a vaccine safety question: Ask your healthcare provider to send an inquiry on your behalf by following the steps above, OR Call 1-800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636) or visit www.cdc.gov/cdc-info.

There are two families of liver flukes that cause disease in humans: Opisthorchiidae (which includes species of Clonorchis and Opisthorchis ) and Fasciolidae (which includes species of Fasciola ). These two families of liver flukes differ in their geographic distribution, life cycle, and long-term outcome after clinical infection. Liver Flukes Clonorchiasis ( Clonorchis Infection) Clonorchis is a liver fluke (type of parasitic worm) that can infect the liver, gallbladder, and bile duct. Clonorchis (also known as Chinese liver fluke disease), is part of the Opisthorchiidae family of liver flukes. You cannot get Clonorchis from another person, and you cannot get it from consuming untreated drinking water. Clonorchis infections can last for several years (the lifespan of the parasite). Fasciola (Fascioliasis Infection) Fasciola is a liver fluke that can infect the liver and bile duct of exposed people and animals, such as sheep, cattle, goats, and other plant-eating domestic and wild animals. Fasciola parasites can cause an infectious disease called fascioliasis. Generally, fascioliasis is more common in people who live or work around livestock (e.g., sheep, cattle, goats) in areas where animal infections are common. Two Fasciola species can infect people: Fasciola hepatica: the main species that infects people. Other names are \"the common liver fluke\" and \"the sheep liver fluke.\" Fasciola gigantica: a related species that primarily affects domestic and wild animals but can also infect people. Fascioliasis occurs in all continents except Antarctica, in over 70 countries, especially where there are sheep, cattle, or goats. In most cases, people can get Fasciola infection by eating raw watercress or other freshwater plants contaminated by larvae. People can get infected by consuming contaminated water that they drink. People can also get infected by eating vegetables that they washed or irrigated with contaminated water. People cannot get Fasciola from another person.

Opisthorchis is part of the Opisthorchiidae family of liver flukes. There is Opisthorchis viverrini (i.e., the Southeast Asian liver fluke) and O. felineus (i.e. , the cat liver fluke). You cannot get Opisthorchis from another person, and you cannot get it from consuming untreated drinking water. Opisthorchis infections can last for several years (the lifespan of the parasite).

It is caused by a toxin that attacks the body’s nerves and causes difficulty breathing, muscle paralysis, and even death. The toxin is made by Clostridium botulinum and related bacteria. There are five main kinds of botulism. All are medical emergencies. Overview Current Infant Botulism Outbreak Learn about a current outbreak of infant botulism linked to infant formula. Botulism (\"BOT-choo-liz-um\") is a rare but serious illness caused by a toxin that attacks the body\\'s nerves. Botulism causes difficulty breathing, muscle paralysis, and even death. The toxin is made by Clostridium botulinum and sometimes Clostridium butyricum and Clostridium baratii bacteria (germs). These bacteria can produce the toxin in food, wounds, and the intestines of infants. The bacteria that make botulinum toxin are found naturally in many places, but it\\'s rare for them to make people sick. These bacteria make spores, which act like protective coatings. Spores help the bacteria survive in the environment, even in extreme conditions. The spores usually do not cause people to become sick, even when they\\'re eaten. But under certain conditions, these spores can grow and make one of the most lethal toxins known. The conditions in which the spores can grow and make toxin are: Low-oxygen or no oxygen (anaerobic) environment Low acid Low sugar Low salt A certain temperature range A certain amount of water For example, improperly home-canned, preserved, or fermented foods can provide the right conditions for spores to grow and make botulinum toxin. When people eat these foods, they can become seriously ill, or even die, if they don\\'t get proper medical treatment quickly. Most common types There are 5 main kinds of botulism. Foodborne botulism Foodborne botulism can happen by eating foods that have been contaminated with botulinum toxin. Common sources of foodborne botulism are homemade foods',\n",

Foodborne botulism Foodborne botulism can happen by eating foods that have been contaminated with botulinum toxin. Common sources of foodborne botulism are homemade foods that have been improperly canned, preserved, or fermented. Though uncommon, store-bought foods also can be contaminated with botulinum toxin. Wound botulism Wound botulism can happen if the spores get into a wound and make a toxin. People who inject illicit drugs have a greater chance of getting wound botulism. People who have had a traumatic injury, such as a motorcycle crash, or surgery also can get wound botulism. Infant botulism For reasons we do not understand, some infants get botulism when the spores get into their intestines, grow, and produce the toxin. Iatrogenic botulism Iatrogenic botulism can happen if too much botulinum toxin is injected for cosmetic reasons, such as for wrinkles. It also can happen if too much of the toxin is injected for medical reasons, such as for migraine headaches. Adult intestinal toxemia Adult intestinal toxemia is also known as adult intestinal colonization. This kind of botulism is a very rare. It can happen if the spores of the bacteria get into an adult's intestines, grow, and produce the toxin (similar to infant botulism). We don't know why people get this kind of botulism. People with a serious health condition affecting the gut might be more likely to get ill. All kinds of botulism can be fatal and are medical emergencies. If you or your child has signs and symptoms of botulism , immediately see your doctor or go to the emergency room. Do not wait.

We do not know how C. sordellii spreads. Women are at highest risk of infection from C. sordellii following the end of pregnancy. Overview Clostridium sordellii (also called C. sordellii ) is a bacterium that, in rare cases, can cause pneumonia, endocarditis, arthritis, peritonitis, myonecrosis, and in some rare cases, bacteremia and sepsis. C. sordellii can be found in the environment (e.g., soil). In some cases, people can carry the bacteria without being infected, known as colonization. The source of C. sordellii is likely the vagina, which is known to be colonized with Clostridium species in some females. Signs and symptoms Nausea Vomiting Diarrhea Sometimes abdominal pain without fever In a small number of cases, people infected with C. sordellii experienced severe toxic shock syndrome, though this was most often associated with gynecologic infections in women and umbilical stump infections in newborns. 1 2 3 At-risk populations Women are at highest risk of infection from C. sordellii following the end of pregnancy, including live births or spontaneous abortion (i.e., miscarriage). Though fatal infections have occurred after medical abortion, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not detected C. sordellii in either of the medications used in the procedure. 4 If women experience symptoms of C. sordellii infections following the end of a pregnancy, it's important they see a healthcare provider for further tests. What CDC is doing CDC experts worked together with state and local health agencies and the FDA to investigate deaths associated with C. sordellii . 4 CDC also works with the FDA to: Raise awareness of research findings in medical and public health communities. Identify cases. Evaluate data. Monitor and decrease risks of medical abortions.

You can get a cold any time of year. Colds usually last less than a week. Overview A cold is a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract (also called an upper respiratory infection or URI). Colds usually last less than a week and are caused by different respiratory viruses. They are also one of the most frequent reasons for missed school and work. Every year in the United States, adults have an average of two to three colds, and children often have more. Signs and symptoms The signs and symptoms of a cold usually peak within 2 to 3 days of infection and can include: Runny nose or nasal congestion Cough Sneezing Sore throat Headache Mild body aches Fever (usually low grade in older children and adults) Complications Complications from infection with respiratory viruses can include: Mild to moderate: Middle ear infections (infection behind the ear drum) Sinus infections Potentially severe: Asthma attacks (wheezing, difficulty breathing) Bronchiolitis (infection of the small airways) Bronchitis (infection of the large airways) Pneumonia (infection of the lungs) Worsening of chronic medical conditions (for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure) Some respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19, flu, and RSV, can have serious outcomes. Outcomes can include hospitalization or death, especially among groups at increased risk for severe illness . This includes infants, older adults, or those with underlying medical conditions or weakened immune systems. Causes and spread Causes More than 200 respiratory viruses can cause colds. Rhinoviruses are the most frequent cause of colds in the United States. Other respiratory viruses that can cause colds in the United States include common human coronaviruses, parainfluenza viruses , adenoviruses , enteroviruses (including EV-D68 ), and human metapneumovirus . SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), influenza virus (the virus that causes flu), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can also cause cold-like symptoms but do not cause colds. These respiratory viruses are more likely to cause severe illness. If you have cold-like symptoms and suspect you have COVID-19 or flu, get tested , especially if you're at higher risk for severe illness. Antiviral treatments are available for COVID-19 and flu and work best when started very soon after symptoms begin. Spread Different respiratory viruses spread in different ways.

Antiviral treatments are available for COVID-19 and flu and work best when started very soon after symptoms begin. Spread Different respiratory viruses spread in different ways. Most respiratory viruses are spread through droplets that an infected person releases when they cough or sneeze. These droplets can enter your body if you breathe them in or touch a contaminated surface and then touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. Some viruses can also spread through close personal contact, such as shaking hands with an infected person and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth. You can get a cold any time of year. Many respiratory viruses, like influenza virus and RSV, usually circulate during winter, but other viruses that can also cause cold symptoms circulate during spring, summer, or fall. Tip You can take steps to reduce your risk of getting a respiratory virus or spreading one to others. Read CDC's Respiratory Virus Guidance .

The resources on this page can support CHWs as they serve communities, and guide health care providers, health systems, community organizations, and others in working with CHWs more effectively. Overview A community health worker (CHW) is a frontline public health worker who lives in or is trusted by the community. A CHW connects people to health and social services by breaking down barriers related to the social determinants of health. The following audiences are most likely to find these resources useful: CHWs, who might be known by other names (e.g., promotores de salud, coaches, lay health advisors, community health representatives, peer mentors, peer navigators). Certified educators, who might be CHWs or belong to another allied clinical group. Community-based organizations, including faith-based organizations and other community groups that work with or host CHWs. Health insurers, purchasers, and payers―including Medicaid, Medicare, commercial insurers, and employers―who have questions about reimbursing for the services that CHWs provide. Health care providers, who want to incorporate CHWs into their practices. Public health professionals who work with CHWs and other groups listed here.

Failure to wear, clean, and store them as directed can increase the risk of eye infections, such as microbial keratitis. Overview When cared for properly, contact lenses can provide a comfortable and convenient way to work, play, and live for the 45 million people in the U.S. who wear them. While contact lenses are usually a safe and effective form of vision correction, they are not entirely risk-free—especially if they are not cared for properly. Contact lenses are medical devices. Failure to wear, clean, and store them as directed can increase the risk of eye infections, such as microbial keratitis. To enjoy the benefits of wearing contact lenses, it is essential to practice healthy habits. Remember: Healthy Habits = Healthy Eyes. Contact lenses are a common form of vision correction Reducing risk Wearing and caring for contact lenses properly is critical to keeping the eyes healthy and preventing eye infections; however, the majority of contact lens wearers do not practice proper contact lens hygiene. Since 2006, in the US there have been multiple outbreaks of Acanthamoeba keratitis and Fungal keratitis —both of which are very serious eye infections that can result in vision loss or blindness. These outbreaks have brought attention to contact lens wearer hygiene and the need for consistent information about how to wear and care for contact lenses to help prevent such infections.

Why it\\'s important Occupational exposure limits (OELs) indicate the maximum allowable concentration of a chemical substance within the workplace. Levels at or above the OEL can increase the risk of workplace exposure. OELs include NIOSH Recommended Exposure Limits (RELs) and OSHA Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs). Most chemicals in commercial use have not been assigned an OEL. Repeated occupational exposure to a chemical, even below its OEL, may not lead to harmful health effects in most workers. Many commercially available chemicals and chemical mixtures have not been assigned an OEL from an authoritative source. Control Banding Process Workplace risks are grouped into control categories or “bands” based on assessing hazard and exposure information. A \"band of hazards\" might be: skin/eye irritant, very toxic, or carcinogenic, among others. The potential for exposure (low, medium, high) is also considered. The exposure potential includes the following considerations: duration of task, amount of chemical handled, or the form of the chemical. At the end of the control banding process, users have a proposed control measure to implement (see example matrix). Example: Control banding matrix Control measures serve to decrease risk. Examples of recommended control measures could be personal protective equipment, dilution ventilation, engineering controls, containment, or some other hazard control. This approach is based on two pillars: there are a limited number of control approaches, and many problems have been met and solved before. Control banding uses the solutions that experts have developed previously to control occupational chemical exposures and suggests applying them to other tasks with similar exposure situations. It is an approach that focuses resources on exposure controls and describes how a risk needs to be managed. NIOSH considers control banding to be a potentially useful tool for small businesses. Using control banding in occupational safety and health practices Control banding is best used with the hierarchy of controls , which aims to protect workers by reducing exposure to hazards in the workplace.

       " \"in occupational safety and health practices Control banding is best used with the hierarchy of controls , which aims to protect workers by reducing exposure to hazards in the workplace. For example, a hazardous chemical can be substituted with a less hazardous chemical. It is important to note that control banding is NOT a replacement for experts in occupational safety and health. Sometimes the control banding advice directly guides employers to seek expert guidance. Specific operating knowledge and professional judgment are required to implement the best combination of controls that are “reasonably practicable” and to minimize risks to workers. Control banding also does not eliminate the need to perform exposure monitoring. How is control banding different than occupational exposure banding? Control banding and occupational exposure banding are both techniques for managing risk for chemicals that do not have an OEL. Occupational exposure banding uses the “banding” concept differently, applying hazard-based data (such as studies on human health effects or toxicology studies) to calculate which of five “bands” is appropriate. Each occupational exposure band (OEB) has an exposure limit range. After completing the OEB process, users must determine whether workplace exposures fall within that range. They must also decide what controls to put in place if the results exceed the range. Once controls are in place, it is important to perform exposure monitoring or assessment to verify the exposures no longer exceed the range of concern. In contrast, control banding ends with specific exposure control and risk management strategies. Control banding can be used together with the OEB methodology. It’s important to note that any control banding or OEB needs follow up. These methods are not a replacement for health surveillance or environmental samples. In addition, this is not a process that should be performed only once. Routine follow-up should always be performed in addition to changes in tasks/process/materials.

Injuries are the leading cause of death for Americans age 1 to 44. Approximately 27 million people suffer non-fatal injuries requiring emergency department (ED) visits. More than 240,000 individuals in the United States die each year because of injuries. Overview The Core State Injury Prevention Program (Core SIPP) supports health department infrastructure, data, and partnerships to identify and respond to existing and emerging injury threats with data-driven public health actions. This support is intended to increase protective factors and reduce risk factors using the best available evidence to prevent injuries and death. The Core SIPP program includes utilizing robust data and surveillance, strengthening strategic collaborations and partnerships, and conducting assessment and evaluation. Why it matters All grant recipients will focus their strategic efforts on preventing Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and transportation-related injury. Recipients can also use up to 25% of their award to address identified priority injury topics of local concern such as drowning, older adult falls, or suicide. An enhanced funding component is available for a smaller number of recipients to implement and evaluate prevention strategies and/or conduct novel surveillance activities. Their goal is to contribute practice-based evidence to strengthen the overall evidence base for injury prevention. CDC is committing approximately $33.5 million to support this grant program.

Review CDC resources, guidelines, and data on correctional health and justice-involved populations Correctional health is community health CDC provides treatment guidelines and other correctional health resources. Correctional health encompasses all aspects of health and well-being for adults and juveniles who are justice system*-involved. This starts at the point of arrest, continues at detention or incarceration, and carries through after they return to their community (called \"reentry\"). Correctional health also includes the health of families and communities of persons who are justice system-involved, as well as the health administrators and staff who work in facilities. Justice System-Involved\\u200e A person who is \\'justice system-involved\\' is any person who is currently or has ever been arrested or incarcerated in a detention or correctional facility. This term also includes those reentering their communities after detention or incarceration, including those on parole or probation. \\'Criminal legal system\\' may also be used as an alternative to \\'justice system\\' to reflect historic and current challenges to achieving justice in the U.S. criminal legal system. Persons who are justice system-involved are more likely to experience risk factors for HIV, viral hepatitis, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), tuberculosis (TB), latent TB infection (LTBI), and traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and concussions . The prevalence of these infections, diseases, and injuries is higher than in the general population. Additionally, a high proportion of people with justice system involvement have a history of unstable housing and mental health and substance use disorders, which increases vulnerability and risk for HIV, viral hepatitis, STIs, tuberculosis/latent tuberculosis infection, and injuries like TBI. This puts many in need of linkage to substance use and mental health treatment, employment, and permanent housing upon release. Justice-involvement also leads to family and community instability and adverse childhood events , with 1 in 28 children having a caregiver who is incarcerated. Taken together, these multiple health conditions and social determinates of health contribute to the health disparities found in this population and their communities.

Develops programs and guidance that address community health disparities and social determinants of health (SDOH). Intake / entry Develops intake screening and treatment guidance for use by clinicians/administrators of correctional health services and health departments.

Develops and provides useful health education materials for staff and justice-involved persons. Reentry Supports projects that improve the continuity of care for people returning to their communities. Offers policy and planning guidance that support efforts to improve the continuity of care within communities. Surveillance Identifies/monitors cases and potential exposures to HIV, viral hepatitis, STIs, TB, and other pathogens among persons who are justice-involved or work in correctional facilities. Statistics The prevalence of infections, diseases, and injuries among people who are incarcerated is higher than in the general population. According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics , over 5 million people are estimated to be under the supervision of U.S. adult correctional systems (in prison or jail, or on probation or parole). Many persons who are justice-involved experience multiple risk factors for HIV, viral hepatitis, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), tuberculosis (TB) and latent TB infection (LTBI), and traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and concussions . The prevalence of these infections, diseases, and injuries among people who are incarcerated is higher than in the general population. HIV In 2021, about 1.1% of persons incarcerated in state and federal prisons were known to be persons with HIV; this rate was three times higher than the prevalence in the general U.S. population. In 2021, 16 U.S. states conducted mandatory HIV testing of all persons under state law enforcement custody, and 23 states and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Prisons offered opt-out HIV testing, accounting for 84% of all persons admitted and sentenced to more than 1 year in the custody of state and federal correctional authorities.

In a 2013 survey of women across 20 metropolitan areas with high HIV prevalence, women who were recently incarcerated were significantly more likely to have factors that increase their risk for HIV infection than those who were never incarcerated, including receiving money or drugs in exchange for sex with a partner, multiple casual partners, multiple casual condomless partners, and sexually transmitted infection (STI) diagnosis. More information on HIV surveillance in the United States . Viral hepatitis In 2009, a systematic review of 23 studies from incarcerated populations in the U.S. reported a wide chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) prevalence range of 0.9%–11.4%. HBV prevalence has been estimated to be 3 to 38 times higher in correctional settings than in the general population in 2009. From 2013–2016, people who were incarcerated were estimated to have a rate of current hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection 10 times higher (10.7% vs 1%) than persons in the general population. Approximately 30% of all persons infected with HCV in the United States spend at least part of the year in correctional facilities. More information on Viral Hepatitis surveillance in the United States . STIs Males and females 35 years of age and younger in juvenile and adult detention facilities have been reported to have higher rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea than nonincarcerated persons in the community. Jail-based chlamydia screen-and-treat programs can potentially decrease chlamydia prevalence in communities with higher incarceration rates —as much as 13% in large communities and 54% in small communities. More information on STIs among persons in correctional facilities . Tuberculosis (TB) In 2021, 2.4% of persons 15 years of age or older diagnosed with tuberculosis were current residents of correctional facilities at the time of diagnosis. From 2003–2013, annual median tuberculosis incidence was about 6 times higher for persons in jails and federal prisons compared with the general population. An analysis during 2011–2019 demonstrated that large tuberculosis outbreaks still occur in state prisons and account for a large proportion of total tuberculosis cases in some states. For more information on TB risk and people who live or work in correctional facilities . Traumatic brain injury (TBI) Research in the United States and from other countries suggests almost half (46%) of people in correctional or detention facilities such as prisons and jails have a history of TBI, but the exact number is not known. Studies show an association between people in correctional or detention facilities with a history of TBI and mental health problems, such as severe depression and anxiety, substance use disorders, difficulty controlling anger, and suicidal thoughts and/or attempts. People in correctional or detention facilities with TBI-related problems may not be screened for a TBI or may face challenges with getting TBI-related care. These challenges may continue after a person is released from the facility. Find more information about TBI and other brain injuries .

There is not a vaccine to prevent Q fever available for use in the United States. Your healthcare provider may order certain blood tests if you are suspected to have Q fever. Most people who have Q fever will recover without antibiotics, but for symptomatic patients, doxycycline is the recommended antibiotic for treatment of Q fever. Overview Q fever is a disease caused by the bacteria Coxiella burnetii . These bacteria naturally infect some animals, such as goats, sheep, and cows. These bacteria are found in the birth products (i.e. placenta, amniotic fluid), urine, poop, and milk of infected animals. People can get infected by breathing in dust that has been contaminated by infected animal feces, urine, milk, and birth products. Some people never get sick; however, those who do usually develop flu-like symptoms including fever, chills, fatigue, and muscle pain. Some people develop chronic Q fever after they are infected. Risk factors People with certain jobs are at increased risk for exposure to Coxiella burnetii , including veterinarians, meat processing plant workers, dairy workers, livestock ranchers, and researchers at facilities housing sheep and goats. People working in these areas may need to take extra precautions (see MMWR R&R: Occupational Exposure and Prevention ). Prevention Q fever vaccines are not available in the United States. Reduce your risk of getting Q fever by avoiding contact with animals, especially while animals are giving birth. Animals can be infected with Coxiella burnetii and appear healthy.

Animals can be infected with Coxiella burnetii and appear healthy. Do not consume raw milk or raw milk products. If you have been diagnosed with Q fever and have a history of heart valve disease, blood vessel abnormalities, a weakened immune system, or are pregnant, talk to your healthcare provider about your risk for developing chronic Q fever. Diagnosis The symptoms of Q fever are similar to many other diseases, often making diagnosis difficult. Common symptoms include, but are not limited to, fever, fatigue, and muscle pain. See your healthcare provider if you develop symptoms after spending time with or near animals—particularly sheep, goats, and cattle—or in areas where these animals may have been. Your healthcare provider may order blood tests to look for Q fever or for other diseases. Laboratory testing and reporting of results can take several weeks, so your healthcare provider may start antibiotic treatment before results are available. Treatment and recovery Most people who are infected with Coxiella burnetii have no symptoms, or mild symptoms, and will recover without antibiotic treatment. For people who develop symptomatic Q fever, treatment with 2 weeks of the antibiotic doxycycline is recommended. Chronic Q fever Develops in some individuals after infection. A life-threatening infection, requiring several months of antibiotic treatment. Treated with a combination of antibiotics including doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine for several months.

CCHF is the most widespread viral hemorrhagic fever, found in Eastern and Southern Europe, the Mediterranean, northwestern China, central Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent. Healthcare workers and people in close contact with livestock are at higher risk for CCHF. Overview CCHF is caused by the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, which is spread by ticks. The CCHF virus can cause sudden illness. CCHF can spread between humans through contact with infectious blood or body fluids. It can result in severe bleeding and death. There's no cure for CCHF. View Larger The CCHF virus is present in the countries in red. Healthcare providers: Review guidance on emergency services, screening, testing, infection control and PPE for viral hemorrhagic fevers, like CCHF, here: Site Index | Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers (VHFs) | CDC Signs and symptoms CCHF symptoms usually appear suddenly and may include: High fever Severe headache Back and joint pain Stomach pain and vomiting Red eyes and flushed face Red spots on the roof of the mouth Jaundice Changes in mood and sensory perception Agitation Drowsiness Bleeding People with CCHF are usually sick for about two weeks. Around the fourth day of illness, large areas of severe bruising, severe nosebleeds, and uncontrolled bleeding at injection sites can develop. Up to 50% of people hospitalized with CCHF will die. How long it takes for signs to show Symptoms can start 1-14 days after being exposed to the virus. Risk factors The following groups of people are at a higher risk of CHHF: People in close contact with livestock in areas where CCHF is found Healthcare workers caring for someone with CCHF without proper PPE How it spreads CCHF virus spreads through: Tick bites from infected hard ticks ( Ixodid) Contact with blood or body fluids of infected animals or humans Improperly sterilized medical equipment Healthcare acquired infections are common.

Avoid contact with body fluids of potentially infected animals or people. If CCHF is suspected and the patient is clinically stable: Healthcare providers should use PPE for clinically stable suspect VHF patients. If CCHF is suspected and the patient is clinically unstable (for example, hemodynamic instability, vomiting) OR CCHF is confirmed regardless of clinical stability: Healthcare providers should use PPE for clinically unstable VHF patients. Testing and diagnosis Healthcare providers diagnose CCHF with the following tests: Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) Detection of antibodies in the blood CCHF is a notifiable condition. Healthcare providers should notify their health department if they suspect a patient has CCHF. Treatment and recovery There is no specific treatment or cure for CCHF. Supportive care includes fluid balance, giving oxygen, managing blood pressure, and treating other infections. An antiviral called Ribavirin has shown some benefits in treating CCHF patients. Recovery is slow, and the long-term effects are not well-studied. More research is needed to determine the efficacy of ribavirin and other antiviral drugs in treating CCHF. Vaccines Currently, there is no widely available or approved vaccine for human use to prevent CCHF. One type of vaccine is used on a small scale in Eastern Europe.

Cronobacter infections are rare but can be deadly for infants, especially newborns. If you think your baby might have a Cronobacter , infection take them to a medical provider as soon as possible. What It Is Cronobacter sakazakii (or \"Cronobacter\" ) and other species are bacteria found naturally in the environment. Cronobacter can live in dry foods, such as powdered infant formula. It has also been found on contaminated feeding items like breast pump equipment. Getting sick from Cronobacter does not happen often, but infections in infants can be deadly. Infants less than 2 months old are most likely to develop meningitis (an inflammation of the membranes that protect the brain and spine) if they are infected with Cronobacter bacteria. Signs and symptoms In infants under 1 year old, Cronobacter usually starts with a fever and poor feeding, excessive crying, or very low energy. Some babies may also have seizures. When to seek emergency care Babies with these symptoms should be taken to a medical provider as soon as possible. Cronobacter infection can lead to serious illness, including Bloodstream infections (sepsis) Swelling of the lining surrounding the brain and spine (meningitis) Urinary tract infections Infection in wounds like cuts, scrapes, or places where people have had surgeries Babies with meningitis may develop serious, long-lasting problems in their brains. People at risk Anyone can get a Cronobacter infection, but newborns are at highest risk of serious illness. Although rare, Cronobacter infections can be life-threatening for newborns because of the risk for sepsis and meningitis. Infections in infants usually occur in the first days or weeks of life. Infants who are more likely to get sick include: Infants younger than 2 months old. These infants are most likely to develop meningitis if they get sick from Cronobacter . Infants born prematurely.

       " \"of life. Infants who are more likely to get sick include: Infants younger than 2 months old. These infants are most likely to develop meningitis if they get sick from Cronobacter . Infants born prematurely. Infants with weakened immune systems. Babies with this condition can't fight germs as well because of illness or medical treatment, such as chemotherapy for cancer. Although less common, older children and adults can also can Cronobacter infection. People 65 and older and people with weakened immune systems are more likely to get Cronobacter in their blood. People with weakened immune systems include those being treated with immune-suppressing drugs for cancer, other illnesses, or organ transplants, or those with HIV infection or genetic conditions. How it spreads Cronobacter bacteria are found naturally in the environment. The bacteria can contaminate dry foods like Powdered infant formula Powdered milk Herbal teas Starches and feeding items like breast pump equipment. Keep in mind Cronobacter infections in infants less than 12 months old are often linked to powdered infant formula. Powdered formula is not sterile and might have germs in it. Powdered infant formula can get contaminated in homes or in processing facilities that make it. In the home You can accidentally get Cronobacter in powdered formula after you open the container. Cronobacter can live on surfaces in your home, such as a kitchen counter or sinks, and in water. In the home, Cronobacter could get into powdered formula: If you place formula lids or scoops on contaminated surfaces and later touch the formula. If you mix the formula with contaminated water or in a contaminated bottle. In a processing facility Cronobacter can also get into powdered infant formula in a processing facility: If the manufacturer uses contaminated ingredients to make the formula. If the formula powder touches a contaminated surface in the facility (or during manufacturing). Prevention To prevent babies from getting Cronobacter infection: Breastfeed if you can. Clean, sanitize, and store infant feeding items safely. Keep hands and surfaces clean. Prepare and store formula safely. Keep Reading Preventing Cronobacter in Infants Quick facts Fact Until 2024, invasive Cronobacter infection was not on the list of nationally notifiable conditions, and Minnesota and Michigan were the only states that required reporting. Because most states did not require reporting before 2024, rates of Cronobacter infection in the United States are not well understood, and the true number of annual cases is unknown. Listing Cronobacter as a nationally notifiable condition will help us learn more about the true number of cases that occur each year. Evidence 1 suggests Cronobacter infections are most common in infants less than 2 months old and often cause death in this age group. Also, infections among older adults may be more common, although milder, than infections among infants. While cases in older children and adults do occur, these cases are not nationally notifiable, and therefore are not currently collected in routine surveillance.

While cases in older children and adults do occur, these cases are not nationally notifiable, and therefore are not currently collected in routine surveillance. Around 20% of infants with meningitis or bloodstream infections due to Cronobacter in the United States have died 2 . Worldwide, approximately 40% of infants reported to have Cronobacter meningitis or bloodstream infections have died 2 . Typically, CDC receives 2-4 reports of severe Cronobacter infections in infants annually from health departments and has received reports from 32 states. From January 2002 to July 2022, CDC received 76 reports of severe Cronobacter illnesses among infants. Testing and diagnosis Cronobacter infection is diagnosed by laboratory testing of blood or cerebrospinal fluid.

It lives in soil contaminated with animal feces (poop). It burrows into people's skin, leaving red, itchy tracks. Most people who are infected recover without treatment. Overview Zoonotic hookworms are parasites that normally live in animals like dogs or cats. However, they can spread to humans through the skin. When they infect people, the hookworms can cause a disease called cutaneous larva migrans (CLM). People become infected when young hookworms, known as larvae, burrow into unprotected skin. This can happen when people are walking barefoot or sitting (with exposed skin) on soil or sand contaminated by animal feces. Signs and symptoms Zoonotic hookworm larva cause CLM by burrowing into the skin of a person's foot or body. This burrowing can cause: Severe itching Raised red lines on skin, also called tracks These symptoms will go away after several weeks as the parasite dies. In rare cases, some types of hookworm may infect deeper tissue in the intestine, lungs, or possibly the eye. Risk factors Cases of CLM often occur in people who have traveled to tropical regions where dog and cat hookworm larvae can survive in the soil. If you walk barefoot in soil or sand in these regions, you can get zoonotic hookworm. However, you can find zoonotic hookworms anywhere in the world. In the United States, they're more common on the East Coast than the West Coast. How it spreads Animals infected with hookworm pass the parasites' eggs out of their body in their feces. The eggs mature and hatch, releasing young hookworms, or larvae, into the soil or sand. When you step on or sit in that soil with your bare skin, hookworm larvae can latch onto you and begin to burrow into your skin. Prevention Dispose of animal waste quickly to keep eggs from getting into soil and hatching. Make sure dogs and cats get regular veterinary care, including deworming if needed. Wear shoes and avoid skin contact with contaminated sand or soil. If you travel to tropical or subtropical climates, especially where there are beaches, wear shoes and use protective mats or other coverings to keep\",\n",

If you travel to tropical or subtropical climates, especially where there are beaches, wear shoes and use protective mats or other coverings to keep your skin from touching sand or soil directly. Diagnosis If you have symptoms of CLM, speak with your healthcare provider. Your provider will examine your skin for itchy, red tracks made by hookworms, usually on the legs or feet. There is no blood test for zoonotic hookworm infection. But your provider may ask you about recent travel and can help provide an accurate diagnosis. Treatment Most people with a zoonotic hookworm infection recover without medical treatment in 5 – 6 weeks, as the parasites that cause CLM die.

These symptoms can happen during or right after someone is exposed: Chest pain and/or chest tightness Dizziness, weakness, and/or confusion Eye pain and/or eye tearing Excitement Restlessness Breathing problems, such as shortness of breath or wheezing Rapid or slow breathing Rapid or slow heart rate Headache Nausea and/or vomiting If exposed to large amounts, signs and symptoms include: Coma Death High or low blood pressure Loss of consciousness Lung injury Seizures These symptoms can happen very quickly when exposed to a large amount of cyanide. These symptoms can happen with any type of exposure (breathing in, skin or eye contact, or swallowing).

Air If cyanide is in the air, people can be exposed through skin or eye contact, or breathing in the cyanide gas. If solid cyanide is put into water, it can make hydrogen cyanide gas (HCN or AC). This can increase chances of breathing in the gas. Cyanide gas is most dangerous in enclosed places where gas will be trapped. Cyanide gas can spread quickly in open spaces depending on the weather. less harmful outdoors. Hydrogen cyanide (HCN or AC) gas is lighter than air, so the gas will rise. Cyanogen Chloride (CNCl or CK) is heavier and will sink to lower areas and increase the risk of exposure there. Cyanide in food Eating, drinking, or touching food or drink with cyanide can expose people to cyanide. This is more likely to happen with solid cyanide. Do not use or eat food that smells, tastes, or looks unusual. Do not eat food that may have touched liquid cyanide if the food is not in a glass or metal container. If the food is in an unbroken sealed glass or metal container, it should not be affected by an cyanide release. Wash the outside of the container before using. Follow any directions by local authorities. What to do if you are exposed Get away Get away from the area where the cyanide was released and breathe fresh air. If the cyanide release was outdoors, go indoors and shelter in place . Make sure windows are closed and ventilation systems are turned off to make sure the cyanide does not come inside. If you cannot go indoors, leave the area where the cyanide was released. If the cyanide release was indoors, get out of the building. Resource Make sure you understand your local emergency notification system if you have one. Listen to emergency broadcasts and local authorities for instructions. Get clean Get clean by taking off all clothes, jewelry, and accessories, blotting any liquid, and showering. Showering is the best method for removing cyanide from your body. If you cannot take off all layers, take off as many clothes as you can. Take your clothes off Do not pull clothing over your head. If you must pull clothing over your head, close your eyes and mouth, and hold your breath. This will prevent the cyanide from getting in your eyes, nose, or mouth. Put clothes in a plastic bag. If you wear contact lenses, take them out and place them with your clothing. Do not put contact lenses back in. If you were exposed to solid cyanide, skip this step and wash your body as described in the next section.

Going in or near water with a harmful algal bloom can make you and your animals sick. Stay out if water looks discolored, has scum, or smells bad. Overview Algae and cyanobacteria (also called blue-green algae) are plant-like organisms that live in water. They can quickly grow out of control, or \"bloom.\" Some of these blooms produce toxins (poisons) that make people and animals sick. What they look like Harmful algal blooms can look like foam, scum, mats, or paint on the surface of the water. They can also grow underneath the water, making some harmful algal blooms hard to see. A bloom can change the color of the water—for example to green, blue, brown, or red. Keep Reading How to Recognize a Harmful Algal Bloom When they\\'re harmful Not all blooms are harmful. Blooms of algae or cyanobacteria can harm people, animals, or the environment if they: Make toxins Become too dense Use up oxygen in the water Release harmful gases Types Many different types of algae can cause harmful algal blooms. However, three types —cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates, and diatoms—cause most blooms that make people and animals sick. Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) are the most common cause of harmful algal blooms in fresh water, such as lakes or rivers. Dinoflagellates or diatoms are the most common causes of harmful algal blooms in salt water, such as oceans or bays. Keep Reading Types of Harmful Algal Blooms Where they\\'re',\n",

Keep Reading Types of Harmful Algal Blooms Where they're found Harmful algal blooms can grow in fresh water, salt water, or brackish water (a mixture of fresh and salt water). This includes water people use for recreation and for drinking. Harmful algal blooms occur across the world. In the United States, they have been reported in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. What causes them Algae and cyanobacteria occur naturally in water. They are more likely to grow into a harmful algal bloom when water is: Warm Slow-moving Full of nutrients, such as nitrogen or phosphorous Nutrients get into water when fertilizer, sewage, or runoff from cities and industrial buildings washes into lakes, rivers, or oceans. This can happen during rainstorms, for example. Environmental changes, such as warmer water, might be making harmful algal blooms worse. Learn more about factors that help harmful algal blooms grow . Health impacts Harmful algal blooms cause a variety of mild to serious illnesses. Symptoms depend on the type of harmful algal bloom you come in contact with and how you are exposed. Keep Reading Symptoms of Illnesses Caused by Harmful Algal Blooms Harmful agal blooms can be deadly for animals Contact a veterinarian immediately if your pets or livestock seem sick after going in or near water. Animals can get very sick or even die within hours of coming into contact with harmful algae or cyanobacteria. Learn more about protecting pets and livestock . Risk of exposure People and animals can get sick from having contact with water or food that contains certain types of algae, cyanobacteria, or their toxins . You or your animals can get sick if you: Go in or near water contaminated by a harmful algal bloom Swallow contaminated water Eat contaminated shellfish or fish Use contaminated blue-green algae dietary supplements Keep Reading How People and Animals Get Sick From Harmful Algal Blooms Preventing exposure You can take steps to avoid getting sick from harmful algal blooms.

Women who are pregnant or planning a pregnancy can be screened to see if they could have a child with CF. Babies born in the U.S. are checked for CF soon after birth as part of newborn screening. Available treatments can improve health outcomes for people with CF. What it is Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that causes problems with breathing and digestion. CF affects about 35,000 people in the United States. People with CF have mucus that is too thick and sticky, which blocks airways and leads to lung damage; traps germs and makes infections more likely; and prevents proteins needed for digestion from reaching the intestines, which decreases the body's ability to absorb nutrients from food. CF affects many different organs in the body, making people with the disease more likely to develop other health conditions including diabetes , cirrhosis (liver disease) , arthritis , reflux , hypersplenism (overactive spleen), and osteoporosis . Signs and symptoms Signs of CF include salty-tasting skin cough that doesn't go away, often with thick mucus or blood wheezing or shortness of breath frequent lung or sinus infections nasal polyps (growths in the nose) poor growth or weight gain in childhood greasy, bad-smelling stools or constipation male infertility Talk to your healthcare provider if you or your child shows signs of CF. A sweat test or genetic testing might be needed. If you or your child have been diagnosed with CF, you can find a CF Care Center near you . Causes CF results from genetic changes (mutations) in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene , which has instructions for making the CFTR protein. Everyone has two copies of the CFTR gene, one copy inherited from their mother and one from their father. A person must have genetic changes in both copies of the CFTR gene to have CF. This means that parents who each have a genetic change in only one copy of the CFTR gene, and therefore do not have the disorder themselves, can together have a child with CF.

       " 'copies of the CFTR gene to have CF. This means that parents who each have a genetic change in only one copy of the CFTR gene, and therefore do not have the disorder themselves, can together have a child with CF. Screening Carrier screening The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that carrier screening for genetic disorders, including CF, be offered to anyone who is considering pregnancy or is currently pregnant. However, this carrier screening does not include all possible CF genetic changes. Because CF sometimes runs in families, if you have a family history of CF and decide to get screened, talk to your healthcare provider to make sure that you are tested for the genetic change that runs in your family. Your healthcare provider might refer you for genetic counseling and testing . Newborn screening All babies born in the United States are checked for CF soon after birth as part of newborn screening . Finding babies with CF early is important so that they can start treatment right away, which can help delay or prevent complications of the disorder. Some people with CF show signs of the disorder soon after birth, although in milder cases, signs might not be seen until adulthood. Treatment Available treatments can help people with CF live longer, healthier lives. Treatments for CF focus on improving breathing and digestion, preventing and treating infections, and thinning mucus. Treatments include medicines, therapy to clear mucus out of the lungs, and in some cases, lung transplant. Pharmacogenomic approaches have led to the development of medicines that target the underlying cause of the disorder. Because different CFTR genetic changes have different effects on the CFTR protein, these medicines can only be used to treat people with certain CFTR genetic changes.

You develop cysticercosis after swallowing tapeworm eggs. Symptoms can occur months to years after infection Overview Cysticercosis is an infection caused by the larvae of the parasite Taenia solium . This infection occurs after a person swallows tapeworm eggs. The larvae get into tissues such as muscle, brain, and eye, and form cysts called cysticerci. When cysts are found in the brain or central nervous system, it is called neurocysticercosis. Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms depend on the location and number of cysts in your body. Symptoms can occur months to years after infection, usually when the cysts start dying. Keep Reading: Symptoms of Cysticercosis How it spreads You get cysticercosis when you swallow tapeworm ( T. solium ) eggs. The eggs are passed in the feces (poop) of someone with a tapeworm. Tapeworm eggs can get in or on food, water, or surfaces contaminated with feces. People swallow the eggs when they consume contaminated food or water or put contaminated fingers in their mouth. Autoinfection is when someone with a tapeworm infects themselves with tapeworm eggs. They can also infect others in the family. Eating pork cannot give you cysticercosis. Keep Reading: How Cysticercosis Spreads Prevention You can take steps to prevent cysticercosis. Sanitation and hygiene precautions Wash your hands with soap and warm water after using the toilet, changing diapers, and before handling food. Teach children the importance of handwashing to prevent infection. Food precautions Wash and peel fruits and vegetables before eating them. Avoid food or water that may be contaminated. When traveling in countries where the water supply may be unsafe, drink only Bottled water Water that has been boiled for one minute Carbonated (bubbly) drinks in sealed containers Diagnosis If you think that you may have cysticercosis, please see your healthcare provider.

Blood tests might not show positive results in mild infections. If surgery is needed, a pathologist will examine the cyst for diagnosis. See additional information on testing for intestinal tapeworm infections on the taeniasis site. Treatment Infections are generally treated with a combination of anti-parasitic drugs and anti-inflammatory drugs. Surgery is sometimes necessary to treat cysts depending on: Location of the cyst The patient's response to drug treatment Amount of brain swelling Treatment isn't always necessary for every case of cysticercosis. Even if you don't need treatment to kill the parasite, you may need treatment for the symptoms caused by the infection, such as medication to reduce seizures.

This parasite used to be called Isospora belli . It is usually spread when people consume contaminated food or water. It is most common in tropical and subtropical areas. Overview Cystoisosporiasis is an intestinal disease caused by the microscopic parasite Cystoisospora belli . This is the same parasite that used to be called Isospora belli . The parasite can be spread by ingesting food or water that was contaminated with feces (stool) from an infected person. Symptoms The most common symptom is watery diarrhea. Other symptoms can include abdominal pain, cramps, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and fever. If untreated, people with weak immune systems, such as people with AIDS, may be at higher risk for severe or prolonged illness. How it spreads People become infected by swallowing mature parasites, for example, by ingesting contaminated food or water. However, oral-anal contact with an infected person might pose a risk for transmission. Infected people shed the immature form of the parasite in their feces. The parasite usually needs about 1 or 2 days in the environment (outside of people) to mature enough to infect someone else. In some settings, the parasite might mature in less than a day. Resource\\u200e DPDx - Cystoisospora life cycle Prevention Avoiding food or water that might be contaminated with stool may help prevent infection. As always, good handwashing and personal-hygiene practices should be followed. Wash your hands with soap and warm water after using the toilet, changing diapers, and before handling food. Teach children the importance of washing hands to prevent infection. Diagnosis Cystoisospora is too small to be seen without a microscope. The infection is diagnosed by examining stool (fecal) specimens under a microscope. More than one specimen may need to be examined to find the parasite. Treatment The infection is treated with prescription antibiotics. The usual treatment is with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, which is also known as Bactrim*, Septra*, or Cotrim*. People who have diarrhea should also rest and drink plenty of fluids.

A healthy person's immune system usually keeps the virus from causing illness. Some babies born with CMV can have health problems at birth or that develop later. What it is CMV is a common virus that infects people of all ages. In the United States, nearly 1 in 3 children is already infected with CMV by age 5. Over half of adults have been infected with CMV by age 40. Once CMV is in a person’s body, it stays there for life and can reactivate. A person can also be re-infected with a different strain of the virus. Signs and symptoms Most people with CMV show no signs or symptoms and aren’t aware that they have been infected. In healthy people Sometimes, infection in healthy people can cause mild illness like: Fever Sore throat Fatigue Swollen glands Occasionally, CMV can cause mononucleosis or hepatitis (liver problems). In people with weakened immunity If you have a weakened immune system and get CMV, you can have more serious symptoms affecting the eyes; lungs; liver; esophagus; stomach; and intestines. In babies Babies born with CMV can have brain, liver, spleen, lung, and growth problems. The most common long-term health problem in babies born with CMV infection is hearing loss. This may be detected soon after birth or may develop later in childhood. Who is at risk Anyone can get CMV.

These conditions begin during the child's developmental period, may impact day-to-day functioning, and usually last throughout a person's lifetime. Most developmental disabilities begin before a baby is born, but some can happen after birth because of injury, infection, or other factors. Causes and risk factors Most developmental disabilities are thought to be caused by a complex mix of factors. These factors include genetics; parental health and behaviors (such as smoking and drinking) during pregnancy; complications during birth; infections the mother might have during pregnancy or the baby might have very early in life; and exposure of the mother or child to high levels of environmental toxins, such as lead. For some developmental disabilities, such as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, which is caused by drinking alcohol during pregnancy, we know the cause. But for most, we don’t. Following are some examples of what we know about specific developmental disabilities: At least 25% of hearing loss among babies is due to maternal infections during pregnancy, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection ; complications after birth; and head trauma. Some of the most common known causes of intellectual disability include fetal alcohol spectrum disorders ; genetic and chromosomal conditions, such as Down syndrome and fragile X syndrome ; and certain infections during pregnancy. Children who have a sibling with autism spectrum disorder are at a higher risk of also having autism spectrum disorder. Low birthweight , premature birth, multiple birth, and infections during pregnancy are associated with an increased risk for many developmental disabilities. Untreated newborn jaundice (high levels of bilirubin in the blood during the first few days after birth) can cause a type of brain damage known as kernicterus. Children with kernicterus are more likely to have cerebral palsy, hearing and vision problems, and problems with their teeth. Early detection and treatment of newborn jaundice can prevent kernicterus. The Study to Explore Early Development (SEED) is a multiyear study\",\n",

Early detection and treatment of newborn jaundice can prevent kernicterus. The Study to Explore Early Development (SEED) is a multiyear study funded by CDC. It is currently the largest study in the United States to help identify factors that may put children at risk for autism spectrum disorders and other developmental disabilities. Keep Reading Learn More About SEED Who is affected Developmental disabilities occur among all racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups. Recent estimates in the United States show that about 1 in 6, or about 17%, of children aged 3 through 17 years have one or more developmental disabilities, such as ADHD Autism spectrum disorder Cerebral palsy Hearing loss Fragile X syndrome Tourette syndrome and other developmental disabilities 1 For more than a decade, CDC’s Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network has been tracking the number and characteristics of children with autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy, and intellectual disability in several diverse communities throughout the United States. Keep Reading CDC's Tracking Method for Autism Spectrum Disorder Keep Reading CDC's Tracking Method for Cerebral Palsy Healthy living for people with disabilities Children and adults with disabilities need health care and health programs for the same reasons anyone else does—to stay well, active, and a part of the community. Having a disability does not mean a person is not healthy or that he or she cannot be healthy. Being healthy means the same thing for all of us—getting and staying well so we can lead full, active lives. That includes having the tools and information to make healthy choices and knowing how to prevent illness. Some health conditions, such as asthma, gastrointestinal symptoms, eczema and skin allergies, and migraine headaches, have been found to be more common among children with developmental disabilities. Thus, it is especially important for children with developmental disabilities to see a health care provider regularly. Keep Reading Learn More About Healthy Living CDC does not study education or treatment programs for people with developmental disabilities, nor does it provide direct services to people with developmental disabilities or to their families. However, CDC has put together a list of resources for people affected by developmental disabilities. Keep Reading Resources for Child Development Don't Wait!

       " \"Background Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects how your body turns food into energy. There are three main types of diabetes: type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes (diabetes while pregnant). More than 122 million Americans are living with diabetes (37.3 million) or prediabetes (96 million). People with diabetes (type 1, type 2, or gestational), even when well-managed, are at higher risk of developing serious flu complications. These complications can result in hospitalization and sometimes even death. Flu-related complications include pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus infections, and ear infections. About 30% of adults hospitalized with flu reported to the CDC had diabetes in recent seasons. Acute illnesses like the flu can make controlling blood sugar levels harder. The flu may raise blood sugar levels. For example, a reduced appetite when sick can cause blood sugar levels to fall. People with diabetes need to follow the sick day guidelines if they become ill. Vaccination is the best protection against flu Flu vaccination is especially important for people with diabetes because they are at higher risk of developing serious flu complications. Flu vaccination also has been associated with reduced hospitalizations among people with diabetes (79%) . Flu Vaccines for People with Diabetes Injectable influenza vaccines (flu shots) are recommended for use in people with diabetes and certain other health conditions . Flu shots have a long, established safety record and studies support the safety of flu vaccines in people with diabetes. People with diabetes should generally not receive the nasal spray flu vaccine (i.e., the live attenuated influenza vaccine or LAIV). Your doctor or other health care professional can answer any questions you might have about flu vaccine. Pneumococcal vaccination is also important Having flu increases your risk of getting pneumococcal disease . Pneumococcal pneumonia is an example of a serious flu-related complication that can cause death. People with diabetes should be up to date with pneumococcal vaccination .

Screening tests show if blood is clotting properly. Clotting factor tests indicate whether a person has hemophilia, the type of hemophilia, and the severity. Who should get tested or screened Families with a history of hemophilia Any family history of bleeding, such as following surgery or injury, or unexplained deaths among brothers, sisters, or male relatives such as maternal uncles, grandfathers, or cousins should be discussed with a doctor to see if hemophilia was a cause. A doctor will often get a thorough family history to find out if a bleeding disorder exists in the family. Some babies should be tested for hemophilia soon after birth, including Babies born to families with a history of hemophilia Babies whose mothers are carriers of hemophilia Babies who have bleeding symptoms at birth Umbilical cord blood testing is better at finding low levels of factor VIII (8) (the factor that is low in hemophilia A) than it is at finding low levels of factor IX (9) (the factor that is low in hemophilia B). This is because factor IX levels take more time to develop and are not at a normal level until a baby is at least 6 months of age. Therefore, a mildly low level of factor IX at birth does not necessarily mean that the baby has hemophilia B. A repeat test when the baby is older might be needed in some cases. Learn more about the inheritance pattern for hemophilia . Families with no previous history of hemophilia About 1 in 3 babies who are diagnosed with hemophilia have no other family members with the disorder.

       " \"history of hemophilia About 1 in 3 babies who are diagnosed with hemophilia have no other family members with the disorder. A doctor might check for hemophilia in a newborn if Bleeding after circumcision of the penis goes on for a long time Bleeding goes on for a long time after drawing blood or doing heel sticks (pricking the infant's heel to draw blood for newborn screening tests) Bleeding in the head (scalp or brain) after a difficult delivery or after using special devices or instruments to help deliver the baby (for example, vacuum or forceps). Unusual, raised bruises or large numbers of bruises If a child with hemophilia is not diagnosed during the newborn period, the family might notice unusual bruising once the child begins standing or crawling. Those with severe hemophilia can have serious bleeding problems right away and are often diagnosed during the first year of life. People with milder forms of hemophilia might not be diagnosed until later in life. When to get tested or screened Many people who have or have had family members with hemophilia will ask that their baby be tested soon after birth. Types of tests Diagnosis includes screening tests and clotting factor tests. Screening tests are blood tests that show if the blood is clotting properly. Clotting factor tests , also called factor assays, determine the clotting activity of factors VIII and IX in the blood. Factors VIII and IX are proteins in the blood that help form clots and stop bleeding. Screening tests Screening tests are blood tests that show if the blood is clotting properly. Types of screening tests include the following: Complete blood count (CBC) This test measures the amount of hemoglobin (the red pigment inside red blood cells that carries oxygen), the size and number of red blood cells, and numbers of different types of white blood cells and platelets found in blood. The CBC might be normal in people with hemophilia. However, if a person with hemophilia has unusually heavy bleeding or bleeds for a long time, the hemoglobin and the red blood cell count can be low. Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) test This test measures how long it takes for blood to clot. It measures the clotting ability of factors VIII (8), IX (9), XI (11), and XII (12). If any of these clotting factors is too low, it takes longer than normal for the blood to clot. The results of this test will show a longer clotting time among people with hemophilia A or B. Prothrombin time (PT) test This test also measures the time it takes for blood to clot. It measures primarily the clotting ability of factors I (1), II (2), V (5), VII (7), and X (10). If any of these factors are too low, it takes longer than normal for the blood to clot. The results of this test will be normal among most people with hemophilia A and B.

The results of this test will be normal among most people with hemophilia A and B. Fibrinogen test This test also helps doctors assess a patient\\'s ability to form a blood clot. This test is ordered either along with other blood clotting tests or when a patient has an abnormal PT or APTT test result, or both. Fibrinogen is another name for clotting factor I. Screening tests and clotting factor tests are used for diagnosis. Clotting factor tests Clotting factor tests, also called factor assays, determine the clotting activity of factors VIII and IX in the blood. Factors VIII and IX are proteins in the blood that help form clots and stop bleeding. Clotting factor tests are required to diagnose a bleeding disorder and will show the type of hemophilia and the severity. It is important to know the type and severity in order to create the best treatment plan. Hemophilia severity classification Baseline clotting factor activity is used to determine hemophilia severity. It is measured prior to receiving any treatment and is used because it best represents a person\\'s inherent clotting factor activity. Results are reported as a percentage of a \"normal\" level of clotting factor. The average normal factor level is 100%, with the normal range generally defined as 50% to 150%. The hemophilia severity categories based on clotting factor levels in the table below were defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) in 2001. 1 2 Severity Levels of factor VIII (8) or factor IX (9) in the blood Mild hemophilia Greater than 5% but less than 40% Moderate hemophilia 1% to 5% Severe hemophilia Less than 1% Table notes. The 2001 ISTH classification did not address individuals with clotting factor levels ≥40% but <50%. However, bleeding has been observed in some individuals with clotting factor levels ≥40% and researchers are taking steps towards classifying these individuals. In 2021 3 , ISTH recommended the following terms for women and girls with an abnormal hemophilia gene who have a clotting factor level ≥40%: \"symptomatic carrier\" (a person who has clotting factor levels ≥40% and bleeding symptoms ) and \"asymptomatic carrier\" (a person who has clotting factor levels ≥40% who does not have bleeding symptoms). Women and girls with an abnormal hemophilia gene who have a clotting factor level <40% are classified as having mild, moderate, or severe hemophilia depending on their exact clotting factor level.

Each dialysis treatment option has varying risks for infection. You can take steps to help prevent infections while receiving dialysis. Overview Your kidneys play a vital role in cleaning your blood, eliminating waste from your body, and supporting other important functions. Dialysis is a medical treatment for kidney failure or kidneys that do not work right. It is not a cure to restore kidney function. Infections are common among people receiving dialysis and can be very serious. Everyone has a role to play in preventing infections and improving dialysis patient safety. You can be a safe patient and take action to help prevent infections. Dialysis treatment options In-center hemodialysis Home hemodialysis Peritoneal dialysis (PD) Each treatment option has varying risks for infection. Discuss treatment options with your doctor to decide which is best based on your needs. Infection risk and terms to know Vein access: also known as vascular access, moves blood between your body and the dialysis machine during hemodialysis treatments. Arteriovenous (AV) fistula: access to the bloodstream created when doctors surgically join an artery and a vein, often in the arm. Once healed, hemodialysis takes place through the fistula. This access type lasts longer than a graft and has the lowest risk of infection. Arteriovenous (AV) graft: access to the bloodstream created when doctors put in a tube that connects an artery and vein. This access type has a higher risk of infection than an AV fistula, but lower than a central line catheter.

Central line catheter: access to the bloodstream created by inserting a tube through the skin into a vein. The tube enters through a vein in the neck, chest, or groin and the tip of the tube ends near the heart. This access type is for short-term use and quick placement, and also has the highest risk of infection. Healthcare providers may use a central line catheter if treatment needs to begin soon, you have damaged veins and arteries or you experience barriers to other types of vein access.

Reducing the use of central venous catheters for people on dialysis can help prevent bloodstream infections. How germs spread When someone is sick with a respiratory infection in a dialysis facility, you can breathe in respiratory droplets after a sick person coughs or sneezes. Germs can also spread through contact with contaminated equipment surfaces, through unclean hands or through vein access points when proper infection control processes are not used. Steps to take Keep your hands clean and cover your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze. Learn about the dialysis process: know what to expect during treatment and things healthcare staff do to protect you from infections. Watch the CDC's Speak Up video for questions to ask during your dialysis treatments. Check your access daily and notify staff if you notice any of these signs of infection: Redness Pus or unusual drainage Swelling Notify staff if your catheter bandage gets dirty or wet. Ask staff if you can use a fistula or graft for treatment if you have a central line catheter. Make sure all staff clean their hands before and after caring for you or your access. In some cases, you may need to take extra actions to prevent infections. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic . Possible infections Bloodstream infections (BSIs), most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus (staph). Some types of staph may be resistant to antibiotics, such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Chronic viral infections such as hepatitis B , hepatitis C , and HIV .

Signs and symptoms depend on how much you were exposed to, how you were exposed, and for how long. If you were exposed, get clean and get medical care. Background Riot control agents (also called \"tear gas\") are chemical compounds that temporarily make people unable to function. It does this by causing irritation to the eyes, mouth, throat, lungs, and skin. Several different compounds are riot control agents: Chloroacetophenone (CN) Chlorobenzylidenemalononitrile (CS) Chloropicrin (PS) - also used as a fumigant Bromobenzylcyanide (CA) Dibenzoxazepine (CR) Combinations of various agents. Where it is found Riot control agents are used by law enforcement officials for crowd control. It is also used by individuals and the general public for personal protection (for example, pepper spray). CS is also used in military settings to test the speed and ability of military personnel to use their gas masks. How it works Riot control agents work by causing irritation to the area of contact (for example, eyes, skin, nose) within seconds of exposure. The effects usually only last 15 to 30 minutes after the person is away from the source and cleaned off. Signs and symptoms The level of poisoning depends on the amount someone was exposed to, how the person was exposed, and for how long. It also depends on the location of exposure (indoors versus outdoors). People exposed to riot control agents may experience some or all of the following symptoms immediately after exposure: Eyes: excessive tearing, burning, blurred vision, redness Nose: runny nose, burning, swelling Mouth: burning, irritation, difficulty swallowing, drooling Lungs: chest tightness, coughing, choking sensation, noisy breathing (wheezing), shortness of breath Skin: burns, rash Other: nausea and vomiting Long lasting exposure or exposure to a large dose may cause severe effects such as: Blindness Glaucoma - a serious eye condition that can lead to blindess Immediate death due to',\n",

Exposure Riot control agents such as CN and CS are liquids or solids (for example, powders). Therefore, they could be released in the air as fine droplets or particles. If agents are released into the air, people could be exposed through skin contact, eye contact, or breathing them in. What to do if you are exposed Since breathing in riot control agents is the primary way of exposure, leave the area and get fresh air. Quickly moving to an area where fresh air is available is highly effective in reducing exposure to riot control agents. If the riot control agents were released outdoors, move away from the area where the agents were released. Stay away from dense, low-lying clouds of riot control agent vapor. Go to the highest ground possible. Riot control agents will form a dense vapor cloud that can travel close to the ground. If the riot control agents were released indoors, get out of the building. Evacuate or \"shelter in place\" If you are near a release, emergency teams may tell you to evacuate the area or \" shelter in place \" inside. If you think you were exposed\\u200e Take your clothes off, wash your body, and get medical care as quickly as possible. Dial 911 and explain what has happened. Take off your clothes Remove the clothing as quickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of pulling it over the head. If you are helping others, do not touch unsafe areas. Wash your body Wash any riot control agents from your skin with lots of soap and water. Washing with soap and water will protect you from any chemicals on your body. If your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes. If you wear contacts, remove them and put them with the dirty clothing. Do not put the contacts back in your eyes (even if they are not disposable contacts). If you wear eyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. You can put your eyeglasses back on after you wash them. Throw your clothes away After you have washed yourself, place your clothing inside a plastic bag. Avoid touching unsafe areas of the clothing. If you can\\'t avoid touching unsafe areas, or you aren\\'t sure where the unsafe areas are, wear rubber gloves. You can also use tongs, tool handles, sticks, or similar objects to put the clothing in the bag. Anything that touches the dirty clothing should also be placed',\n",

If you wear contacts, put them in the plastic bag, too. Seal or tie the bag, and then put that bag inside another plastic bag. Throwing away your clothes this way helps protect you and others from any chemicals that might be on your clothes. When the local or state health department or emergency team arrive, tell them what you did with your clothes. The health department or emergency team will arrange for further disposal. Do not handle the plastic bags yourself. Keep Reading: About Getting Clean Treatment Treatment involves helping the affected person get more oxygen in his or her blood and stopping chemical burns from getting worse. Medications that are used to treat asthma (such as bronchodilators and steroids) may also be used to help the person breathe. Treating eye exposures involves rinsing the eyes with water until there is no sign of riot control agents in the eyes. Burn injuries to the skin are treated with standard burn management techniques, including use of medicated bandages. No antidote exists for poisoning from riot control agents.

People most likely get infected by accidentally swallowing the parasite. Many infected people do not have any symptoms. To prevent infections, wash your hands thoroughly after using the toilet or changing diapers, and before preparing food. Overview Dientamoeba fragilis is a protozoan parasite, meaning it is a microscopic, single-celled organism that multiplies in people. D. fragilis lives in the large intestine of people. It is still not entirely clear whether this organism causes disease in people. Many people carrying the parasite have no symptoms, but gut-related symptoms have been associated with this parasite in some people. Infection is common in the United States and globally. Resource\\u200e Healthcare providers can find more information on the Clinical Care of Dientamoeba fragilis page. Signs and symptoms Many people have no symptoms. If symptoms are present, the most common are diarrhea and/or abdominal pain. Other symptoms can include loss of appetite, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. Causes It is unclear how D. fragilis spreads. Most likely, people get infected by accidentally swallowing the parasite; this is called fecal-oral transmission. This could be through contaminated food or water, person-to-person, or animal fecal (poop) contact. The D. fragilis parasite is fragile and cannot live very long in the environment (after it passes in feces) or in stomach acid (after it is swallowed). Prevention To prevent infection with D. fragilis , Wash your hands with soap and water after using the toilet, after changing diapers, and before preparing or eating food. Teach children the importance of washing hands to prevent infection. Diagnosis Your healthcare provider can take a stool (poop) sample and examine it for D. fragilis infection. You may have to submit stool samples from more than one day as the parasite is not in every sample. People infected with D. fragilis can also have pinworm eggs. Your healthcare provider may test for both. Treatment and recovery Safe and effective medications are available to treat D. fragilis infection. Talk to your healthcare provider if you think you may have D. fragilis infection.

You can get infected by eating raw or undercooked fish. You can treat Diphyllobothriid infection with medication. Overview Dibothriocephalus latu s, and related species (belonging to the family Diphyllobothriidae, also called fish or broad tapeworms), are the largest tapeworms to infect people. They can grow to up to 30 feet long. Most people infected with fish tapeworms have no symptoms. However, complications can include intestinal obstruction (blockages in the intestines) and gall bladder disease. This happens when the segments of the tapeworm (called proglottids) move or migrate in the body. Several different Diphyllobothriid species infect humans. Resource\\u200e Healthcare providers can find more information on the Clinical Care of Diphyllobothriid Tapeworm Infection page. Signs and symptoms Most people with fish tapeworm infection have no symptoms. If you do have symptoms, they can include Abdominal discomfort Diarrhea Vomiting Weight loss Vitamin B12 deficiency leading to anemia Complications include intestinal obstruction and gall bladder disease caused by migration of proglottids (segments of the tapeworm). If you think you have a fish tapeworm infection, see your healthcare provider. Causes You can get Diphyllobothriid tapeworm infection by eating raw or undercooked fish from many parts of the world. One type of fish tapeworm infects freshwater fish such as trout, perch, or pike. It is found in the Northern Hemisphere (Europe, independent states of the Former Soviet Union, North America, Asia), and rarely in the southern hemisphere countries. Other species of fish tapeworm infect fish which live in both fresh and salt water, such as salmon. Fish infected with tapeworm larvae may be sent to and eaten in any area of the world. Prevention The easiest way to prevent Diphyllobothriid infection is to not eat raw or undercooked fish. Adequately freezing or cooking fish will kill the parasite. The FDA recommends the following for fish preparation or storage to kill parasites. Cooking Cook fish adequately (to an internal temperature of at least 145° F [~63° C]) Freezing At -4°F (-20°C) or below for 7 days (total time), or At -31°F (-35°C) or below until solid, and storing at -31°F (-35°C) or below for 15 hours, or At -31°F (-35°C) or below until solid and storing at -4°F (-20°C) or below for 24 hours\",\n",

In dogs, it is called heartworm infection. Infection is spread by mosquito bites. Overview Dirofilaria are long, thin parasitic roundworms that infect a variety of mammals. Infection is transmitted by mosquito bites. There are many species of Dirofilaria , but human infection is caused most commonly by three species, D. immitis , D. repens , and D. tenuis . The main natural hosts for these three species are dogs and wild canids, such as foxes and wolves ( D. immitis and D. repens ) and raccoons ( D. tenuis ). D. immitis is also known as \"heartworm.\" D. repens is not found in the United States, and D. tenuis appears to be restricted to raccoons in North America. Dirofilariasis is the disease caused by Dirofilaria worm infections. In dogs, one form is called \"heartworm disease\" and is caused by D. immitis . D. immitis adult worms can cause pulmonary artery blockage in dogs, leading to an illness that can include cough, exhaustion upon exercise, fainting, coughing up blood, and severe weight loss. Symptoms Human infections with D. immitis can result in areas of inflammation induced by dying adult worms in pulmonary arteries that appear as coin lesions on chest x-rays. Coin lesions can also be caused by cancer and other serious diseases, and a coin lesion discovered accidentally on chest x-ray usually leads to an invasive procedure to learn the cause. Most human cases of pulmonary dirofilariasis are diagnosed from samples taken during these procedures. Most reported cases of D. immitis infection in humans have been in persons with no symptoms. People with symptoms can have cough (including coughing up blood), chest pain, fever, and pleural effusion (excess fluid between the tissues that line the lungs and the chest cavity). Rarely, D. immitis worms have been found in humans at outside the lungs, including the brain, eye, and testicle. When D. repens and D. tenuis infection is reported in humans, it is generally as the cause of nodules under the skin, but on occasion, worms are found in the conjunctiva. Who is at risk Dirofilariasis is found throughout the world where Dirofilaria species are common. In the United States, canine dirofilariasis has been reported from all states, and D. tenuis in raccoons is common',\n",
       " 'the cause of nodules under the skin, but on occasion, worms are found in the conjunctiva. Who is at risk Dirofilariasis is found throughout the world where Dirofilaria species are common. In the United States, canine dirofilariasis has been reported from all states, and D. tenuis in raccoons is common in many areas where raccoons are found. Canine and human dirofilariasis are most prevalent in eastern and southeastern states, although rates are increasing rapidly in a number of western states. D. immitis is the Dirofilaria species most commonly reported to cause dirofilariasis in humans in the United States. D. repens is the Dirofilaria species most commonly reported to cause dirofilariasis among humans in Europe. One or both of these species have been found to cause human dirofilariasis in other parts of the world. How it spreads The definitive mammalian hosts for Dirofilaria are primarily domestic dogs, wild canids (such as wolves and foxes), and raccoons. In these hosts, sexually mature worms produce microfilariae that circulate in the blood and are ingested by mosquitoes during a blood meal. In mosquitoes, the microfilariae develop into larvae that migrate to the proboscis (the long, tubular part of the mouth of the mosquito that punctures the skin during a blood meal), where they are ready to infect another host during a blood meal. Several types of mosquitoes are capable of transmitting Dirofilaria infection, including Aedes , Anopheles , and Mansonia . Humans and a wide range of other mammals are accidental hosts that play no role in the transmission of Dirofilaria . In these hosts, Dirofilaria larvae can develop into adult worms but the worms remain sexually immature and no microfilariae are produced. Resource\\u200e DPDx - Dirofilaria life cycle Prevention Dirofilariasis can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites in areas where mosquitoes may be infected with Dirofilaria larvae. The risk of such mosquito bites can be reduced by leaving as little skin exposed as possible, by the use of insect repellent when exposed to mosquitoes, and by sleeping under an insecticide-treated bednet in areas where Dirofilaria -infected mosquitoes bite at night and have access to sleeping areas. Diagnosis In humans, dirofilariasis is diagnosed most frequently by the examination of tissue from areas of inflammation in the lung obtained as part of the diagnostic investigation of coin lesions (small, round abnormalities) on chest x-rays or from the examination of tissue in nodules under the skin. Blood tests are not yet helpful in the diagnosis of dirofilariasis in humans. Treatment The definitive treatment of Dirofilaria infection in humans is surgical removal of lung granulomas and nodules under the skin; this treatment is also curative. In many cases, no treatment with medicines is necessary. This information is not meant to be used for self-diagnosis or as a substitute for consultation with a health care provider.

When we know what is happening, we can determine what the needs are, plan the response, and gather the appropriate resources. These actions can help to decrease mortality and morbidity and improve prevention and mitigation strategies for future disasters. Typically, the main objectives of disaster epidemiology are the following: Prevent or reduce the number of deaths, illnesses, and injuries caused by disasters Provide timely and accurate health information for decision-makers Improve prevention and mitigation strategies for future disasters by gaining information for future response preparation Available tools State, tribal, local, and territorial (STLT) health departments should look first at the tools they are using in non-disaster settings to assess their applicability for adaption to a disaster response. CDC provides various tools for public health disaster response including template forms for morbidity surveillance, mortality surveillance, shelter assessments, and the Community Assessment for Public Health Emergency Response , CASPER toolkit . Request CDC assistance CDC provides scientific consultation, technical assistance, and disaster epidemiology training to STLT, federal, and international public health partners to help them respond to natural and human-induced disasters. There are several ways you can request CDC assistance. If you would like more information on CDC consultation, technical assistance, or disaster epidemiology training, please visit the training and technical assistance webpage. Public health surveillance during a disaster Public health surveillance is the systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of deaths, injuries, and illnesses to provide information about any adverse health effects related to a disaster event in a community. It allows us to assess the human health impacts of a disaster and evaluate potential problems related to planning and prevention. Purpose Public health morbidity surveillance allows us to detect disease outbreaks and track disease and injury trends. A common myth\",\n",
       " 'effects related to a disaster event in a community. It allows us to assess the human health impacts of a disaster and evaluate potential problems related to planning and prevention. Purpose Public health morbidity surveillance allows us to detect disease outbreaks and track disease and injury trends. A common myth is that epidemics are inevitable during a disaster. Early detection and response, however, can lessen the likelihood for outbreaks. Additionally, conducting health surveillance allows public health leaders and decision makers to make informed decisions about action items such as allocating resources, tailoring interventions to meet specific needs, and planning for future disasters. In addition to public health morbidity surveillance, mortality surveillance can provide information that can prevent excess death. The number of deaths is a strong indicator of the impact of the disaster. Disasters can overwhelm local medical examiners and emergency systems, disrupting typical reporting methods. Most mortality surveillance data (such as Vital Statistics) are collected in a way that is not timely or detailed enough to be useful for disaster response. Thus, implementing active mortality surveillance following a disaster provides a critical aspect to response. Available tools CDC has several ready-to-use templates for morbidity and mortality surveillance. These tools can supplement existing surveillance systems or replace surveillance systems that have been hindered or destroyed due to a disaster. For more information, review the Tools and Resources page. Creating a surveillance system During disasters, several steps may need to be conducted simultaneously when planning a surveillance system. Just as purpose and objective should be clear in any disaster response effort, the surveillance system should have well-defined objectives. Additionally, data sources need to be identified and selected. Facility-based surveillance of hospitals and emergency medical operations can provide information on those seeking care during a disaster, yet there is often the need to use additional nontraditional sources of information (such as a shelters, pharmacies, or physician offices) as well. Ideally, data collection instruments for surveillance should be developed, tested, and distributed before the disaster occurs (e.g., CDC-developed surveillance tools). However, these instruments will need to be modified for each disaster and location. The data collection instrument should collect only the most essential information and should have easy data entry. For information to be useful, it must be disseminated in a timely fashion through appropriate channels (e.g., public health and other government officials, relief workers, the affected community, and the media). Keep Reading: Public Health Surveillance During a Disaster Community Assessment for Public Health Emergency Response (CASPER) The Community Assessment for Public Health Emergency Response (CASPER) is a type of rapid needs assessment (RNA). The assessment is designed to provide public health leaders and emergency managers with household-based information about a community. It is quick, reliable, relatively inexpensive, and flexible. CASPER uses valid statistical methods to gather information. They can be conducted throughout the disaster cycle (preparedness, response, recovery, mitigation) and in non-disaster situations.

Children have unique needs during and after disasters. Children are different Children's bodies are different from adults' bodies They are more likely to get sick or severely injured. They breathe in more air per pound of body weight than adults. They have thinner skin, and more of it per pound of body weight (higher surface-to-mass ratio). They have less fluid in their bodies, so fluid loss (e.g. dehydration, blood loss) can have a bigger effect on children. They are more likely to lose too much body heat. They spend more time outside and on the ground. They put their hands in their mouths more often than adults. Children in an emergency Children need help from adults in an emergency Children don't fully understand how to keep themselves safe. Older children and adolescents may take their cues from others. Young children may cry, scream, or become paralyzed with fear. They may not be able to explain what hurts or bothers them. They are more likely to get the care they need when they have parents or other caregivers around. Adults are required by law to make medical decisions for a child. Adults will sometimes have to make decisions with limited information on the ways some illnesses and medicines affect children. Children's mental health Mental stress from a disaster can be harder on children They feel less of a sense of control. They understand less about the situation. They have fewer experiences bouncing back from hard situations. Resources Disasters can strike without any warning. Family members may not all be in the same place.

Nine people in the United States are killed every day in crashes that are reported to involve a distracted driver. 2 In the United States, over 3,100 people were killed and about 424,000 were injured in crashes involving a distracted driver in 2019. 2 About 1 in 5 of the people who died in crashes involving a distracted driver in 2019 were not in vehicles―they were walking, riding their bikes, or otherwise outside a vehicle. 2 Distracted driving deaths over time Sources: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2010-2013 , 2014–2018 and 2019 You can visit the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website for more information on how data on motor vehicle crash deaths are collected and the limitations of distracted driving data. People at increased risk Young adult and teen drivers are more at risk for distracted driving than other age groups. Among fatal crashes involving distracted drivers in the U.S. in 2019 a higher percentage of drivers ages 15–20 were distracted than drivers age 21 and older. 2 Keep reading: Distracted Driving Risk Factors What's being done State and Federal efforts to prevent distracted driving include: Many states have enacted laws to help prevent distracted driving.

In dogs, it is called heartworm infection. Infection is spread by mosquito bites. Overview Dirofilaria are long, thin parasitic roundworms that infect a variety of mammals. Infection is transmitted by mosquito bites. There are many species of Dirofilaria , but human infection is caused most commonly by three species, D. immitis , D. repens , and D. tenuis . The main natural hosts for these three species are dogs and wild canids, such as foxes and wolves ( D. immitis and D. repens ) and raccoons ( D. tenuis ). D. immitis is also known as \"heartworm.\" D. repens is not found in the United States, and D. tenuis appears to be restricted to raccoons in North America. Dirofilariasis is the disease caused by Dirofilaria worm infections. In dogs, one form is called \"heartworm disease\" and is caused by D. immitis . D. immitis adult worms can cause pulmonary artery blockage in dogs, leading to an illness that can include cough, exhaustion upon exercise, fainting, coughing up blood, and severe weight loss. Symptoms Human infections with D. immitis can result in areas of inflammation induced by dying adult worms in pulmonary arteries that appear as coin lesions on chest x-rays. Coin lesions can also be caused by cancer and other serious diseases, and a coin lesion discovered accidentally on chest x-ray usually leads to an invasive procedure to learn the cause. Most human cases of pulmonary dirofilariasis are diagnosed from samples taken during these procedures. Most reported cases of D. immitis infection in humans have been in persons with no symptoms. People with symptoms can have cough (including coughing up blood), chest pain, fever, and pleural effusion (excess fluid between the tissues that line the lungs and the chest cavity). Rarely, D. immitis worms have been found in humans at outside the lungs, including the brain, eye, and testicle. When D. repens and D. tenuis infection is reported in humans, it is generally as the cause of nodules under the skin, but on occasion, worms are found in the conjunctiva. Who is at risk Dirofilariasis is found throughout the world where Dirofilaria species are common. In the United States, canine dirofilariasis has been reported from all states, and D. tenuis in raccoons is common',\n",
       " 'the cause of nodules under the skin, but on occasion, worms are found in the conjunctiva. Who is at risk Dirofilariasis is found throughout the world where Dirofilaria species are common. In the United States, canine dirofilariasis has been reported from all states, and D. tenuis in raccoons is common in many areas where raccoons are found. Canine and human dirofilariasis are most prevalent in eastern and southeastern states, although rates are increasing rapidly in a number of western states. D. immitis is the Dirofilaria species most commonly reported to cause dirofilariasis in humans in the United States. D. repens is the Dirofilaria species most commonly reported to cause dirofilariasis among humans in Europe. One or both of these species have been found to cause human dirofilariasis in other parts of the world. How it spreads The definitive mammalian hosts for Dirofilaria are primarily domestic dogs, wild canids (such as wolves and foxes), and raccoons. In these hosts, sexually mature worms produce microfilariae that circulate in the blood and are ingested by mosquitoes during a blood meal. In mosquitoes, the microfilariae develop into larvae that migrate to the proboscis (the long, tubular part of the mouth of the mosquito that punctures the skin during a blood meal), where they are ready to infect another host during a blood meal. Several types of mosquitoes are capable of transmitting Dirofilaria infection, including Aedes , Anopheles , and Mansonia . Humans and a wide range of other mammals are accidental hosts that play no role in the transmission of Dirofilaria . In these hosts, Dirofilaria larvae can develop into adult worms but the worms remain sexually immature and no microfilariae are produced. Resource\\u200e DPDx - Dirofilaria life cycle Prevention Dirofilariasis can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites in areas where mosquitoes may be infected with Dirofilaria larvae. The risk of such mosquito bites can be reduced by leaving as little skin exposed as possible, by the use of insect repellent when exposed to mosquitoes, and by sleeping under an insecticide-treated bednet in areas where Dirofilaria -infected mosquitoes bite at night and have access to sleeping areas. Diagnosis In humans, dirofilariasis is diagnosed most frequently by the examination of tissue from areas of inflammation in the lung obtained as part of the diagnostic investigation of coin lesions (small, round abnormalities) on chest x-rays or from the examination of tissue in nodules under the skin. Blood tests are not yet helpful in the diagnosis of dirofilariasis in humans. Treatment The definitive treatment of Dirofilaria infection in humans is surgical removal of lung granulomas and nodules under the skin; this treatment is also curative. In many cases, no treatment with medicines is necessary. This information is not meant to be used for self-diagnosis or as a substitute for consultation with a health care provider.

It is a parasite that can also infect people. Dipylidium infection is easily treatable in dogs, cats, and people. Overview Dipylidium caninum is a common tapeworm of dogs and cats in the United States and throughout the world. Dogs and cats get Dipylidium tapeworm by swallowing a flea infected with a tapeworm larvae, often while grooming themselves. The larval tapeworm will then develop into an adult tapeworm in the animal's intestine. People get Dipylidium tapeworm the same way dogs and cats do, by swallowing a flea infected with tapeworm larvae. The adult tapeworm is made up of many small segments called proglottids. Each proglottid is about the size of a grain of rice. Adult tapeworms may measure 4 – 28 inches in length. As the tapeworm grows inside the intestine, these segments (proglottids) break off and pass in the stool. Resource\\u200e Healthcare providers can find more information on the Clinical Care of Dipylidium page. Signs and symptoms Most dogs and cats infected with Dipylidium tapeworm do not show signs of illness. However, you can sometimes see the proglottids crawling near the animal's anus (butt) or on the surface of a fresh bowel movement. Dried out proglottids look like grains of rice: they are small, about 2 mm, hard, and yellowish in color. You can sometimes see them stuck to the fur around your pet's butt. Most people infected with Dipylidium tapeworms also do not show signs of illness. It is more likely that you will recognize a Dipylidium infection when you see tapeworm segments in your or your child's feces (poop). Causes Dogs and cats get Dipylidium tapeworm by swallowing a flea infected with a tapeworm larvae, often while grooming themselves. The larval tapeworm will then develop into an adult tapeworm in the animal's intestines. The segments of the adult tapeworm, proglottids, break off and pass in the animal's stool. The proglottids contain tapeworm eggs. Once the proglottid dries out, the eggs release into the environment. Flea larvae then feed on the Dipylidium eggs and start the cycle over again.

Flea larvae then feed on the Dipylidium eggs and start the cycle over again. People get Dipylidium tapeworm the same way dogs and cats do, by swallowing a flea infected with tapeworm larvae. Most reported cases are in children. Prevention The most effective way to prevent Dipylidium infection in pets and people is through flea control. Other ways to prevent infection include Have your veterinarian treat your dogs and cats if they have tapeworms. Clean up after your pet, especially in playgrounds and public parks. Place the poop in a plastic bag and dispose of it in the trash. If plastic bags or trash are not available, bury it. Do not allow children to play in areas soiled with pet or other animal feces. Teach children to always wash their hands after petting or playing with dogs and cats, and after playing outdoors. Diagnosis In Dogs and Cats Your veterinarian will not typically find Dipylidium tapeworm eggs in a routine fecal (poop) exam. They rely on the pet's owner to notice the tapeworm segments (proglottids) crawling around the anus or in the pet's feces. In People Most infections in people are diagnosed clinically. This means your healthcare provider will look for the tapeworm segments around a person's anus or in their feces. Your healthcare provider may also do a stool exam to look for eggs or tapeworm segments. Treatment and recovery Treatment is simple and very effective for both animals and people. If you think your pet has Dipylidium tapeworms, talk to your veterinarian about treating your pet. When people have Dipylidium infection, their healthcare provider can prescribe praziquantel to treat the infection. The medication is well-tolerated and causes the tapeworm to dissolve within the intestine.

Prevent dog scratches and bites Dog bites can cause pain, injury, and spread germs that cause infection. Nearly 1 in 5 people bitten by a dog requires medical attention. Any dog can bite especially when scared, nervous, eating, or when playing or protecting toys or puppies. Dogs may also bite when they aren't feeling well and want to be left alone. There are many things you can do at home and within your community to help prevent dog scratches and bites. Practicing the safe handling tips below can help you avoid dog bites. Know the risks Children are more likely than adults to be bitten by a dog. The injuries from dog bites in children also tend to be more severe. Most dog bites affecting young children occur during everyday activities and while interacting with familiar dogs. Having a dog in the household is linked to a higher likelihood of being bitten than not having a dog. As the number of dogs in the home increases, so does the likelihood of being bitten. Adults with two or more dogs in the household are five times more likely to be bitten. This is comparison to people living without dogs at home. Among adults, men are more likely than women to be bitten by a dog. How to prevent dog bites and scratches Most dog bites are preventable. Do not disturb a dog while it is eating, sleeping, or caring for puppies. Do not pet a dog if it appears to be hiding or seeing time alone. Do not continue petting a dog if it seems scared, sick, or angry. If a dog knocks you over, curl into a ball. Tuck your head and place your\",\n",

If a dog knocks you over, curl into a ball. Tuck your head and place your hands over your ears and neck. You can also put a purse, bag, or jacket between you and the dog. Avoid doing the following actions to keep yourself safe: Never encourage your dog to play aggressively or roughhouse. Do not panic or make loud noises, and never run from a dog. Avoid trying to break up dog fights. Petting another owner\\'s dog Always ask if it is OK to pet someone else\\'s dog before reaching out to pet it. This is important even if the dog appears friendly. Let the new dog approach you first. When a new dog approaches you, remain still to allow the dog to feel comfortable. Always make sure a dog has seen you and sniffed you before you reach out to pet it. Preventing dog bites in children Do not let young children play with dogs without supervision, even if the child has met the dog previously. This includes your family pet dog. Responsible pet ownership, including socializing your dog and using a leash in public, can help prevent dog bites. Preventing bites from unfamiliar dogs Do not approach an unfamiliar dog, even if it seems friendly or healthy. Call animal control if you see a dog in trouble or a dog running loose. If an unfamiliar dog approaches you, stay still, be calm, and avoid direct eye contact with the dog. Say \"no\" or \"go home\" in a firm, deep voice and stand with the side of your body facing the dog. Slowly raise your hands to your neck with your elbows in. Wait for the dog to pass or slowly back away. What to do if you are bitten or scratched by a dog Germs can be spread from dog bites and scratches, even if the wound does not seem deep or serious. For minor wounds Wash the wound thoroughly with soap and water. Apply an antibiotic cream. Cover the wound with a clean bandage. For deep wounds Apply pressure with a clean, dry cloth to stop the bleeding for deep wounds. Seek medical attention right away. Call 911 or your local emergency medical services immediately if you cannot stop the bleeding or you feel faint or weak. See if a healthcare provider if: The wound is serious or deep. The wound becomes infected. You don\\'t know if the dog has been vaccinated against rabies. If it has been more than 5 years since your last tetanus shot. The bite is deep.

Intimate partner violence has a profound impact on lifelong health, opportunity, and well-being. What is intimate partner violence? Intimate partner violence (IPV) is abuse or aggression that occurs in a romantic relationship. Intimate partner refers to both current and former spouses and dating partners. IPV can vary in how often it happens and how severe it is. It can range from one episode of violence to chronic and severe episodes over multiple years. IPV can include any of the following types of behavior: Physical violence is when a person hurts or tries to hurt a partner by using physical force. Sexual violence is forcing or attempting to force a partner to take part in a sex act, sexual touching, or a non-physical sexual event (e.g., sexting) when the partner does not or cannot consent. Stalking is a pattern of repeated, unwanted attention and contact by a partner that causes fear or concern for one's own safety or the safety of someone close to the victim. Psychological aggression is the use of verbal and non-verbal communication with the intent to harm a partner mentally or emotionally or to exert control over a partner. For more information about IPV definitions please see Intimate Partner Violence Surveillance: Uniform Definitions and Recommended Data Elements, Version 2.0. Quick facts and stats IPV is common. It affects millions of people in the United States each year. Data from CDC's National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS) indicate: 1 About 41% of women and 26% of men experienced contact sexual violence, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner during their lifetime and reported a related impact. A Over 61 million women and 53 million men have experienced psychological aggression by an intimate partner in their lifetime. IPV starts early and continues throughout people's lives. When IPV occurs in adolescence, it is called teen dating violence . About 16 million women and 11 million men\",\n",
       " \"related impact. A Over 61 million women and 53 million men have experienced psychological aggression by an intimate partner in their lifetime. IPV starts early and continues throughout people's lives. When IPV occurs in adolescence, it is called teen dating violence . About 16 million women and 11 million men who reported experiencing intimate partner violence in their lifetime said that they first experienced it before age 18. 1 While violence impacts all people, some individuals and communities experience inequities in risk for violence due to the social and structural conditions in which they live, work, and play. Youth from groups that have been marginalized are at greater risk of experiencing sexual and physical dating violence. 2 Outcomes Intimate partner violence can result in injuries and even death. Data from U.S. crime reports suggest that about one in five homicide victims are killed by an intimate partner. The reports also found that over half of female homicide victims are killed by a current or former male intimate partner. 3 Many other negative health outcomes are associated with intimate partner violence. These include conditions affecting the heart, muscles and bones, and digestive, reproductive, and nervous systems, many of which are chronic. 3 Survivors can experience mental health problems such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. They are at higher risk for engaging in behaviors such as smoking, binge drinking, and risky sexual activity. People from groups that have been marginalized, such as people from racial and ethnic minority groups, are at higher risk for worse consequences. 4 Although the personal consequences of intimate partner violence are devastating, there are also many costs to society. The lifetime economic cost associated with medical services for IPV-related injuries, lost productivity from paid work, criminal justice and other costs, is $3.6 trillion. The cost of IPV over a victim’s lifetime was $103,767 for women and $23,414 for men. 5 Prevention Intimate partner violence can be prevented. Certain factors may increase or decrease the risk of perpetrating or experiencing intimate partner violence. Preventing intimate partner violence requires understanding and addressing the factors that put people at risk for or protect them from violence. Promoting healthy, respectful, and nonviolent relationships and communities can help reduce the occurrence of intimate partner violence. It also can prevent the harmful and long-lasting effects of intimate partner violence on individuals, families, and communities.

Families and healthcare providers in the United States have learned over time how to improve care for people living with Down syndrome. Children with Down syndrome are living longer, many into their adult years. Ongoing, appropriate medical care can help children and adults with Down syndrome live as healthy lives as possible. Down syndrome in the United States Each year, about 5,700 babies born in the United States have Down syndrome. This means that Down syndrome occurs in about 1 in every 640 babies. Life expectancy The life expectancy of people with Down syndrome increased dramatically between 1960 and 2007. 1 In 1960, on average, persons with Down syndrome lived to be about 10 years old. In 2007, on average, persons with Down syndrome lived to be about 47 years old. Many factors can affect how long a person with Down syndrome lives. Babies born with a very low birth weight or a congenital heart defect are less likely to survive their first year. 2 3 There are also racial disparities, with Black infants having a lower survival past the first year. More research is needed to help understand why.

A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. The disease affects communities in remote parts of Africa that do not have safe water to drink. There is no treatment nor a vaccine for Guinea worm disease. Overview Dracunculiasis, also known as Guinea worm disease (GWD), is an infection caused by the parasite Dracunculus medinensis. GWD is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) transmitted to people mostly by consuming unsafe water. Unfiltered drinking water from ponds or other stagnant surface water sources can contain near-microscopic crustaceans called copepods (tiny \"water fleas\") that are infected with Guinea worm larvae (immature forms of the Guinea worm). Signs and symptoms People do not usually have GWD symptoms until about one year after infection. Then, a mature pregnant female worm full of larvae creates a blister on the skin through which she will emerge and expel her larvae when she comes in contact with water. A few days to hours before the worm, which can measure up to 3 feet (1 meter) in length, comes out of the skin, a person may develop fever, swelling, and pain in the area. Most worms come out of people\\'s legs and feet, though worms can come out of other body parts, too. Challenges People in remote rural communities who have GWD often lack access to healthcare. When the adult female worm comes out of the skin, it can be very painful, disabling, and take a long time to remove. The emerging worm can cause a wound that may develop a secondary infection. People at risk Anyone who consumes drinking water from a pond or other stagnant water source contaminated with infected copepods is at risk for infection. People\\'s risk for disease can vary. People do not get immunity after GWD, which means they can get it again. GWD transmission also has a seasonal pattern. How it spreads Water contact triggers the Guinea worm to release a milky white liquid that contains hundreds of thousands of immature larvae into the water.

People and animals might also become infected by eating certain aquatic animals (e.g., fish or frogs) that have swallowed infected copepods. People and animals infected with GWD can then spread the disease when the worm matures and is ready to emerge from the body if they enter ponds and other stagnant water sources that others drink from. Prevention Guinea worm is a disease that has been prioritized for eradication by the World Health Organization. There were an estimated 3.5 million Guinea worm cases occurring annually in 20 African and Asian countries in 1986, but today, through the Guinea Worm Eradication Program (GWEP), only a handful of countries continue to have the disease. GWEP undertakes several water-related and other measures to prevent GWD: Surveillance and case containment Safe water practices, including distribution of cloth and pipe filters to remove copepods, and advocacy for installation or rehabilitation of safe drinking water supplies like borehole wells Vector control Health education and community mobilization Quick facts There were 14 human GWD cases reported in 2023 in Chad, South Sudan, Mali, Cameroon, and Central African Republic. There were 714 animal GWD infections reported in 2023, which is a slight increase compared to 2022 following expanded surveillance activities. WHO has certified 200 countries free from Guinea worm. The six countries that have not yet been certified as free from Guinea worm are Angola, Chad, Ethiopia, Mali, South Sudan, and Sudan. Treatment and recovery There is no drug to treat Guinea worm infection. Once part of the worm begins to come out of the wound, it is important that all of the worm is removed to prevent complications. Anti-inflammatory medicine can help reduce pain and swelling, and antibiotic ointment can help prevent infections. Vaccines There is no vaccine to prevent Guinea worm infection.

A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. The disease affects communities in remote parts of Africa that do not have safe water to drink. There is no treatment nor a vaccine for Guinea worm disease. Overview Dracunculiasis, also known as Guinea worm disease (GWD), is an infection caused by the parasite Dracunculus medinensis. GWD is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) transmitted to people mostly by consuming unsafe water. Unfiltered drinking water from ponds or other stagnant surface water sources can contain near-microscopic crustaceans called copepods (tiny \"water fleas\") that are infected with Guinea worm larvae (immature forms of the Guinea worm). Signs and symptoms People do not usually have GWD symptoms until about one year after infection. Then, a mature pregnant female worm full of larvae creates a blister on the skin through which she will emerge and expel her larvae when she comes in contact with water. A few days to hours before the worm, which can measure up to 3 feet (1 meter) in length, comes out of the skin, a person may develop fever, swelling, and pain in the area. Most worms come out of people\\'s legs and feet, though worms can come out of other body parts, too. Challenges People in remote rural communities who have GWD often lack access to healthcare. When the adult female worm comes out of the skin, it can be very painful, disabling, and take a long time to remove. The emerging worm can cause a wound that may develop a secondary infection. People at risk Anyone who consumes drinking water from a pond or other stagnant water source contaminated with infected copepods is at risk for infection. People\\'s risk for disease can vary. People do not get immunity after GWD, which means they can get it again. GWD transmission also has a seasonal pattern. How it spreads Water contact triggers the Guinea worm to release a milky white liquid that contains hundreds of thousands of immature larvae into the water. In ponds and other stagnant water sources, these larvae are',\n",

Driving while impaired by any substance is dangerous and illegal. There are effective measures that can help prevent injuries and deaths from impaired driving. Effects of substances on driving Safe driving requires focus, coordination, good judgment, and quick reactions to the environment. Any alcohol or other drug use impairs the ability to drive safely. The amount of alcohol in a person's system can be measured. This measurement is called blood alcohol concentration (BAC). Most states have set the legal BAC limit for driving at 0.08 grams of alcohol per deciliter (g/dL); the limit is 0.05 g/dL in Utah. 1 However, impairment starts at lower BAC levels. Information on the effects of alcohol on driving at a range of BACs is available here . We know a lot about alcohol's effects on driving, but more research is needed to fully understand the impact of drugs on driving skills. 2 However, research has shown that both legal and illicit drugs impair the skills needed to drive safely. For example: Some of the effects of being impaired by cannabis that can affect driving include slowed reaction time and decision making, impaired coordination, and distorted perception. 2 3 4 5 Other drugs (such as cocaine or illicit amphetamines) can also impair skills like perception, memory, and attention in the short or long term. 2 Prescription and over-the-counter medications can cause many side effects that can impact driving, such as sleepiness, impaired vision, and impaired coordination. 6 Use of multiple substances (such as cannabis and alcohol) at the same time can increase impairment. 5 7 Impacts In 2022, 13,524 people were killed in motor vehicle crashes involving alcohol-impaired drivers, accounting for 32% of all traffic-related deaths in the United States. 8 37 people in the United States are killed every day in crashes involving an alcohol-impaired driver — this is one death every 39 minutes. 8 It is not known\",\n",

Keep Reading: Impaired Driving Facts People at increased risk Some groups are more at risk for impaired driving and related crashes and deaths. These include teen drivers and passengers, 10 young adult drivers, men, and drivers who don't always wear a seat belt. 8 Keep Reading: People at Increased Risk for Impaired Driving What the research shows There are multiple effective measures that states and communities can take to prevent alcohol-impaired driving. These include actively implementing and enforcing lower BAC limits 11 and implementing sobriety checkpoints. 12 Keep Reading: Preventing Impaired Driving What you can do For drivers : Plan ahead. If you plan to drink alcohol or use drugs, make plans so that you do not have to drive. For everyone : Don't let your friends drive while impaired by alcohol and/or drugs.

Periods of drought can result in inadequate water supply and can lead to public health problems. Take action and learn how drought can impact your health and the health of your family. Overview Droughts can last from a single season to many decades and can affect from a few hundred to millions of square miles. With our changing climate, historically dry areas of the United States are likely to experience an increased risk of drought. Drought can affect areas or communities differently depending on several additional variables, including: the structure and capacity of existing water systems, local governance of water use, urban vs. rural land use, economic development, the at-risk populations living in the affected area, and other societal factors, such as the presence of local community networks. Health impacts Severe drought conditions can negatively affect air quality. During drought, there is an increased risk for wildfires and dust storms. Particulate matter suspended in the air from these events can irritate the bronchial passages and lungs. Chronic respiratory illnesses can become worse, and the risk for respiratory infections like bronchitis and pneumonia can increase. The health impacts of drought are numerous and far reaching. Some drought-related health effects are experienced in the short-term and can be directly observed and measured. However, the slow rise or chronic nature of drought can result in longer term, indirect health impacts that are not always easy to anticipate or monitor. The possible public health impacts of drought include: compromised quantity and quality of drinking water; increased recreational risks; effects on air quality; diminished living conditions related to energy, air quality, and sanitation and hygiene; mental health effects related to economic and job losses; compromised food and nutrition; and increased incidence of illness and disease.

Access to comprehensive prevention services is essential for all persons who inject drugs. Syringe services programs (SSPs) are community-based prevention programs that can provide a range of services, including access to and disposal of sterile syringes and injection equipment, vaccination, testing, and linkage to infectious disease care and substance use treatment. Nearly 30 years of research shows that comprehensive syringe services programs (SSPs) are safe, effective, and cost-saving, do not increase illegal drug use or crime, and play an important role in reducing the transmission of viral hepatitis, HIV and other infections.

This means the medicine can no longer kill the TB germs. Drug-resistant TB disease is difficult and costly to treat. The most important way to prevent drug-resistant TB disease is for all people being treated for TB disease to take all TB medicine exactly as prescribed. Drug-resistant TB disease should be treated by a TB medical expert. Overview Some TB germs are resistant to medicines used to treat TB disease. This means that the medicine can no longer kill the TB germs. Drug-resistant TB disease means that the TB germs are resistant to at least one of the most effective TB medicines. Types There are different types of drug-resistant TB disease, depending on what medicines the TB germs are resistant to. Multidrug-resistant TB disease (MDR TB) is caused by germs that are resistant to two or more of the main TB medicines: isoniazid and rifampin. Two more serious forms of MDR TB are called pre- extensively drug-resistant TB (pre-XDR TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR TB) .

       " 'germs that are resistant to two or more of the main TB medicines: isoniazid and rifampin. Two more serious forms of MDR TB are called pre- extensively drug-resistant TB (pre-XDR TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR TB) . Pre-XDR and XDR TB are rare types of TB disease that are resistant to nearly all medicines used to treat TB disease. People at risk Drug-resistant TB disease is more common in people who: Have spent time with someone known to have drug-resistant TB disease. Come from areas of the world where drug-resistant TB disease is common. Develop TB disease again, after being treated for TB disease in the past. Do not take all of their TB medicines. Do not take their TB medicines regularly. Causes Exposure to drug-resistant TB germs Some people develop drug-resistant TB disease because they are exposed to drug-resistant TB germs. Drug-resistant TB germs are spread the same way that drug-susceptible TB germs are spread. TB is spread through the air from one person to another. The TB germs are put into the air when a person with TB disease of the lungs or throat coughs, speaks, or sings. These germs can stay in the air for several hours, depending on the environment. TB germs are more likely to spread in indoor areas or other places with poor air circulation (such as a closed vehicle) than in outdoor areas. People who have spent time with someone who is sick with drug-resistant TB disease can become infected with these resistant TB germs. Keep Reading: How Tuberculosis Spreads Drug-resistant TB disease can occur when the medicines used to treat TB are misused or mismanaged. Examples of misuse or mismanagement include: People do not complete a full course of treatment for TB disease. Health care providers prescribe the wrong treatment for TB disease (the wrong dose or length of time). Medicines for proper treatment of TB disease are not available. TB medicines are poor quality. Prevention You can help prevent drug-resistant TB disease. Take all TB medicines exactly as prescribed by your health care provider. Do not miss any doses and do not stop treatment early. Tell your health care provider if you are having trouble taking the medicines, for example, if your medicine makes you throw up, you get a fever, or develop a rash. Diagnosis Part of a medical evaluation for TB disease includes laboratory tests to find TB germs. If these tests find TB germs, laboratories perform additional tests to see if the germs are resistant to any of the TB medicines. Keep Reading: Diagnosing Tuberculosis Treatment Treating and curing drug-resistant TB disease is complicated. People with drug-resistant TB disease must be treated with special medicines. Treatment may take a long time, sometimes months or years and the medicines can cause side effects.

People can get dwarf tapeworm by consuming food or water contaminated by dwarf tapeworm eggs. Dwarf tapeworm occurs worldwide, most often in people living in areas with poor sanitation and people living in institutional settings. Overview Dwarf tapeworm (i.e., Hymenolepis nana ) is a type of parasitic tapeworm. The infection occurs worldwide. Adult dwarf tapeworms are very small compared to other tapeworms. They can be anywhere from 15 – 40 mm (up to 2 in.) in length. The adult dwarf tapeworm consists of many small parts called \"proglottids.\" When the dwarf tapeworm matures in the intestine, these proglottids break off and people pass them in their stool (poop). Adult dwarf tapeworms can live for 4 – 6 weeks. Resource\\u200e Healthcare providers can find more information on the Clinical Care of Hymenolepiasis (Dwarf Tapeworm) page. Signs and symptoms Most people infected with dwarf tapeworm do not have symptoms. When people do have symptoms, they can include one or more of the following: Nausea Weakness Loss of appetite Diarrhea Abdominal pain Children, especially those with heavy infections (a high number of tapeworms) can have the following symptoms: Headache Itchy bottom Difficulty sleeping At-risk populations Dwarf tapeworm infections can occur worldwide. Infection is common among children, as well as people living in institutional settings, and those living in areas with unimproved sanitation facilities (when there is no sanitary separation of human waste from human contact). How it spreads People can get dwarf tapeworm infection when they accidentally consume dwarf tapeworm eggs. This can happen when people consume fecal (poop) contaminated food or water, often when people touch their mouths with unclean hands or eating something with contaminated soil. People can also become infected if they accidentally consume an infected insect (an intermediate host, such as a small beetle or mealworm) that can contaminate food you eat. People can spread the infection to others. Dwarf tapeworm eggs are infectious, which means they can re-infect you or infect others immediately after they are shed in feces (poop). Prevention To avoid getting dwarf tapeworm infection, people should take the following steps: Wash your hands with',\n",

Dwarf tapeworm eggs are infectious, which means they can re-infect you or infect others immediately after they are shed in feces (poop). Prevention To avoid getting dwarf tapeworm infection, people should take the following steps: Wash your hands with warm water after using the toilet, changing diapers, and before preparing foods. Teach children the importance of handwashing to prevent infection. When traveling to countries where there is a higher risk of food contamination, wash, peel, or cook all raw vegetables and fruits with safe water (sanitized water, such as bottled, boiled, or filtered water) before eating. See more on Handwashing . Diagnosis If you think you have dwarf tapeworm infection, see a healthcare provider. Treatment and recovery If diagnosed with dwarf tapeworm infection, a healthcare provider will treat you with praziquantel (the treatment of choice) or niclosamide or nitazoxanide (alternative drugs). These medications will cause the dwarf tapeworm to dissolve (break down) in the intestine. Depending on the infection, a person might have to have more than one treatment. Niclosamide is not available in the US. Myths and misconceptions A dwarf tapeworm does not cause weight loss. You cannot feel the dwarf tapeworm inside your body.

EBV can cause infectious mononucleosis and other illnesses. There is no vaccine to protect against EBV infection. What it is Epstein-Barr virus, or EBV, is one of the most common human viruses in the world. EBV is also known as human herpesvirus 4 and is a member of the herpes virus family. Most people will get infected with EBV in their lifetime, especially in childhood, and will not have symptoms. EBV infections in children usually do not cause symptoms, or the symptoms are not distinguishable from other mild, brief childhood illnesses. About mononucleosis\\u200e EBV is the most common cause of infectious mononucleosis, also called \"mono.\" This contagious disease is common among teens and adults. Learn more Signs and symptoms Symptoms of EBV infection can include: Fatigue Fever Inflamed throat Swollen lymph nodes in the neck Enlarged spleen Swollen liver Rash People who get symptoms from EBV infection, usually teenagers or adults, get better in 2 to 4 weeks. However, some people may feel fatigued for several weeks or even months. Who is at risk After you get an EBV infection, the virus becomes latent (inactive) in your body. In some cases, the virus may reactivate. This does not always cause symptoms, but people with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop symptoms if EBV reactivates. How it spreads You can spread the virus for weeks!\\u200e When you first get EBV, you can spread it for weeks and even before you have symptoms. Once EBV is in your body, it stays inactive. If it reactivates, you can potentially infect others no matter how much time has passed since the first infection. EBV is most commonly spread through saliva by: Kissing Sharing drinks and food Sharing drinking cups, eating utensils, or toothbrushes Having contact with toys that children have drooled on The virus probably survives on an object at least as long as the object remains moist. EBV can also spread through blood and semen during sexual contact, blood transfusions, and organ transplantations. Prevention',\n",

EBV can also spread through blood and semen during sexual contact, blood transfusions, and organ transplantations. Prevention There is no vaccine to protect against EBV infection. You can help protect yourself by reducing contact with people who have EBV infection. Make sure you avoid : Kissing Sharing drinks and food Using the same personal items that an infected person recently used Testing and diagnosis Diagnosing EBV infection can be challenging because the symptoms are similar to other illnesses. EBV infection can be confirmed with a blood test that detects antibodies. About 9 out of 10 adults have antibodies that show that they have a current or past EBV infection.

Infections caused by ESBL-E can occur both in and outside of healthcare settings. Good hand hygiene and infection prevention practices can help reduce infection risk. Overview Enterobacterales Enterobacterales are a group of bacteria that cause infections in healthcare settings and communities. Some species are also a normal part of the human gut. ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) Some Enterobacterales produce enzymes called extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). Antimicrobial resistance ESBLs break down certain antibiotics, making some infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacterales difficult to treat. Prevalence In 2017, there were an estimated 197,400 cases of ESBL-E among hospitalized patients and 9,100 estimated deaths in the United States. Types ESBL-producing Enterobacterales include germs like Escherichia coli ( E. coli) and Klebsiella pneumoniae ( K. pneumoniae ). Signs and symptoms ESBL-E can cause several different infections, including urinary tract and bloodstream infections. These bacteria can also live in a patient without causing infection or symptoms, known as colonization. Who is at risk ESBL-E infections occur in healthcare settings like hospitals and nursing homes. These infections may also occur in healthy people. After traveling abroad to places where these germs originate, people returning to the United States are at increased risk. How it spreads ESBL-E can spread from person to person through dirty hands and surfaces. Outside the United States, they can spread through contaminated food or water. The role of food and water in the spread of these germs in the United States is not clear. Reducing risk Patients and caregivers Wash their hands often with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Wash their hands after using the bathroom and before eating or preparing food. Remind people (including healthcare staff) to clean their hands before touching the patient or handling medical devices. Follow recommended practices for food and water safety when traveling abroad. Healthcare providers Healthcare providers should always follow core infection control practices to reduce the risk of spreading these germs to patients.

Testing To determine if someone has an ESBL-E infection, healthcare providers will send a specimen to the laboratory for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. CDC provides data that can be used for setting breakpoints for interpretation of antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Public Health Reference Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (AST) Data Treatment and recovery Antimicrobial resistance and its effect on treatment ESBL-E infections are resistant to many prescribed antibiotics, such as penicillins and cephalosporins. These infections might require hospitalization and intravenous (IV) antibiotics. Carbapenems and risk of greater resistance Carbapenems are often used to treat serious ESBL-E infections, but resistance is on the rise for them, too. The more we rely on this important class of antibiotics, the greater the risk of Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) . What CDC is doing Tracking ESBL-E infections through the Emerging Infections Program and National Healthcare Safety Network . Data is also available on the AR & Patient Safety Portal . Working closely with health departments , other federal agencies, healthcare providers and patients to prevent infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacterales and slow the spread of resistant germs.

Children with asthma may have a higher risk for severe respiratory illness caused by EV-D68 infection. EV-D68 can also cause acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), an uncommon but dangerous neurological condition that mostly affects children. There are no vaccines to prevent EV-D68 infections. What it is EV-D68 is one of more than 100 non-polio enteroviruses . Non-polio enteroviruses are common. Most infections cause no symptoms or only mild symptoms. Infections with enteroviruses are more likely during summer and fall, but can happen year-round. Signs and symptoms EV-D68 can cause mild to severe respiratory illness or no symptoms at all. Mild symptoms may include runny nose, sneezing, cough, and body and muscle aches. Serious symptoms may include wheezing, difficulty breathing, or pneumonia. EV-D68 can also cause acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) , an uncommon but dangerous neurological condition that mostly affects children. Onset of AFM symptoms can start several weeks after an EV-D68 infection. AFM causes the muscles and reflexes in the body to become weak. Symptoms include: Arm or leg weakness Loss of muscle tone and reflexes Pain in the neck, back, arms, or legs Difficulty swallowing or slurred speech Difficulty moving the eyes or drooping eyelids Facial droop or weakness Keep Reading Signs and Symptoms of Acute Flaccid Myelitis Call your doctor right away if: You or your child develop AFM symptoms, or if you or your child have difficulty breathing, or if symptoms worsen. Who is at risk In general, infants, children, and teenagers are most likely to get infected with enteroviruses and become ill. This is because they do not yet have immunity (protection) from previous exposure to these viruses, including EV-D68. Adults can get infected with enteroviruses, but they are more likely to have no symptoms or mild symptoms. Children with\",\n",

Children with underlying medical conditions may be at higher risk for more severe illness from EV-D68 and other respiratory illnesses. Children with asthma Children with asthma may be at higher risk for severe symptoms from EV-D68 and other respiratory illnesses. Families should follow CDC guidance to maintain control of symptoms during enterovirus season. The season occurs each year in the United States during summer and fall. See Also Managing Asthma and EV-D68 Symptoms How it spreads Since EV-D68 causes respiratory illness, the virus can be found in an infected person’s respiratory secretions, such as: Saliva Nasal mucus Sputum (mucus-like secretions from the lungs) EV-D68 likely spreads from person to person when an infected person: Coughs Sneezes Touches a surface that is then touched by others Prevention There are no vaccines to prevent EV-D68 infections. However, you can take certain actions to help protect yourself and others from health risks caused by respiratory viruses, including EV-D68. CDC's Respiratory Virus Guidance provides practical recommendations and information to help lower your risk. To prevent severe illness from EV-D68, children and adults with asthma should also follow CDC's guidance on how to manage their asthma. Keep Reading Preventing Respiratory Illnesses Testing and diagnosis Many hospitals and some doctors can test ill patients to see if they have an enterovirus or rhinovirus infection. However, most hospitals and doctors cannot do specific testing to determine the type of enterovirus, like EV-D68. CDC and some state health departments can determine different enterovirus types by doing specialized tests. For Public Health Laboratory Testing for Non-Polio Enterovirus Managing EV-D68 and asthma CDC recommends the following: Discuss and update your asthma action plan with your primary care provider. Take your prescribed asthma medications, especially long-term control medications. Be sure to keep your reliever medication with you. Get a flu vaccine each year and talk to your healthcare provider about getting a COVID-19 vaccine. If you develop new or worsening symptoms, follow your asthma action plan. If your symptoms do not go away, call your doctor right away. If you support a child with asthma, be sure other caregivers and/or teachers are aware of the child's condition and know how to help. Keep Reading About Asthma Treatment and recovery There is no specific treatment or antiviral available for people with respiratory illness caused by EV-D68.

It could be an ear infection. Some ear infections, in particular some middle ear infections, need antibiotic treatment, but many can get better without antibiotics. Talk to your child\\'s healthcare provider about the best treatment. Overview Children are more likely than adults to get ear infections. There are different types of ear infections. Middle ear infection (acute otitis media) is an infection in the middle ear. Otitis media with effusion is another condition that affects the middle ear. Occurs when fluid builds up in the middle ear without causing an infection. Does not cause fever, ear pain, or pus build-up in the middle ear. Swimmer\\'s ear is an infection in the outer ear canal. Different from a middle ear infection. For more information, visit \"Swimmer\\'s Ear\" (Otitis Externa) A healthy ear including outer, middle, and inner ear. An infected ear showing inflammation and fluid in the ear. Signs and symptoms Ear pain Fever Fussiness or irritability Rubbing or tugging at an ear Difficulty sleeping Causes Bacteria, like Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae (nontypeable), are the two most common bacteria causing middle ear infection. Viruses, like those that cause colds can cause middle ear infection. Prevention Help prevent ear infections by doing your best to stay healthy and keep others healthy: Receive recommended vaccines, such as flu vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine . Pneumococcal vaccine protects against a common cause of middle ear infections , Streptococcus pneumonia . Clean your hands . Breastfeed exclusively until your baby is 6 months old and continue to breastfeed for at least 12 months. Don\\'t smoke and avoid exposure to secondhand smoke.

Talk to a healthcare provider right away\\u200e If your child is under 3 months old with a fever of 100.4 °F (38 °C) or higher. Diagnosis A healthcare provider can diagnose a middle ear infection by asking about symptoms and examining your child. They will look inside your child's ear to examine the eardrum and look for pus in the middle ear. Treatment Talk to your child's healthcare provider about the best treatment. The body's immune system can often fight off middle ear infection on its own. Sometimes you do not need antibiotics for middle ear infections. Severe middle ear infections or infections that last longer than 2–3 days need antibiotics right away. For mild middle ear infection, your healthcare provider might recommend watchful waiting or delayed antibiotic prescribing . Watchful waiting: Your child's healthcare provider may suggest watching and waiting for 2-3 days to see if your child needs antibiotics. This gives the immune system time to fight off the infection. If your child's symptoms don't improve, the healthcare provider may prescribe an antibiotic. Delayed prescribing: Your child's healthcare provider may prescribe an antibiotic but suggest that you wait 2–3 days before filling the prescription. Your child may recover on their own and may not need the antibiotic. How to feel better Rest. Drink extra water or other fluids. Take over-the-counter medicines to relieve pain or fever. These actions can make you feel better, even if you use antibiotics. Ask your healthcare provider about over-the-counter medicines that can help you feel better. Always use over-the-counter medicines as directed. Remember, over-the-counter medicines may provide temporary relief of symptoms, but they will not cure your illness. Over-the-counter medicine and children Carefully read and follow instructions on over-the-counter medicine product labels before giving medicines to children. Healthcare providers do not recommend some over-the-counter medicines for children of certain ages. Pain relievers: Children younger than 6 months: only give acetaminophen. Children 6 months or older: it is OK to give acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Never give aspirin to children because it can cause Reye's syndrome. Reye's syndrome is a very serious, but rare illness that can harm the liver and brain. Cough and cold medicines: Children younger than 4 years old: do not use over-the-counter cough and cold medicines in young children unless a healthcare provider specifically tells you to. Cough and cold medicines can result in serious and sometimes life-threatening side effects in young children. Children 4 years or older: discuss with your child's healthcare provider if over-the-counter cough and cold medicines are safe to give to your child. Ask your healthcare provider about the right dosage of over-the-counter medicines for your child's age and size.

Orthoebolaviruses are found primarily in sub-Saharan Africa. Orthoebolaviruses can cause serious and often deadly disease, with a mortality rate as high as 80 to 90 percent. There is an FDA-approved vaccine for the prevention of Ebola virus (species O rthoebolavirus zairense). What it is Ebola disease is caused by a group of viruses, known as orthoebolaviruses (formerly ebolavirus) 1 . These viruses can cause serious illness that, without treatment, can cause death. Orthoebolaviruses were discovered in 1976 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and are found primarily in sub-Saharan Africa. Healthcare providers: Review guidance on emergency services, screening, testing, infection control and PPE for viral hemorrhagic fevers, like Ebola disease, here: Site Index | Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers (VHFs) | CDC Types There are four orthoebolaviruses that cause illness in people: Ebola virus (species O rthoebolavirus zairense ) causes Ebola virus disease. Sudan virus (species O rthoebolavirus sudanense ) causes Sudan virus disease. Taï Forest virus (species O rthoebolavirus taiense ) causes Taï Forest virus disease. Bundibugyo virus (species O rthoebolavirus bundibugyoense ) causes Bundibugyo virus disease. Some orthoebolaviruses do not cause illness in people. Reston virus (species Orthoebolavirus restonense ) can cause illness in nonhuman primates and pigs. Bombali virus (species Orthoebolavirus bombaliense ) was identified in bats, but scientists don\\'t know if it causes illness in animals or people. Signs and symptoms People with Ebola disease may experience \"dry\" symptoms early in the course of illness. These symptoms may include fever, aches, pains, and fatigue. As the person becomes sicker, the illness typically progresses to \"wet\" symptoms and may include diarrhea, vomiting, and unexplained bleeding.

Keep Reading Signs and Symptoms of Ebola Disease How long it takes for signs to show Someone with Ebola disease may start getting sick 2 to 21 days after contact with an orthoebolavirus. However, on average, symptoms begin 8 to 10 days after exposure. Risk factors Healthcare providers and family members caring for someone with Ebola disease without proper infection control methods have the highest risk of infection. The viruses that cause Ebola disease pose little risk to travelers or the general public. How it spreads People can get Ebola disease through contact with the body fluids of an infected sick or dead person. Rarely, some people can get the disease from contact with an infected animal, like a bat or primate. Keep Reading How Ebola Disease Spreads Prevention When living in or traveling to regions where viruses that spread Ebola disease may be present, take steps to protect yourself. Avoid contact with body fluids Avoid contact with body fluids from people and animals, including Blood and body fluids, like urine, feces, saliva, sweat, vomit, breast milk, amniotic fluid, semen, and vaginal fluid from people who are sick. Semen from someone who has recovered from Ebola disease, until testing shows that the virus is no longer in the semen. Clothes, bedding, needles, medical equipment, or other items that may have touched an infected person\\'s blood or body fluids. The body of someone who is suspected or confirmed to have had Ebola disease (such as during a funeral or burial practices). Bats, forest antelopes, primates, and blood, fluids, or raw meat from these or unknown animals. Wear protective equipment Wear protective equipment if you come in contact with people who are sick or have died from Ebola disease, their blood and body fluids, or objects covered with their blood or body fluids. Monitor your health If you return from an area with an ongoing Ebola outbreak, monitor your health for 21 days. Seek medical care immediately if you develop symptoms of Ebola disease. Ebola Vaccine The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved ERVEBO® for the prevention of Ebola disease (species Orthoebolavirus zairense only). Vaccination is recommended for U.S. adults 18 years and older who are at potential risk of exposure to the Ebola virus. Ebola Vaccine Product Information Testing and diagnosis Healthcare providers use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing to diagnose Ebola disease. They can also test for orthoebolavirus antibodies. Someone being tested for Ebola disease should be separated from other people in a healthcare facility until results are confirmed.

Echinococcosis is classified as either cystic echinococcosis or alveolar echinococcosis. Each species causes different symptoms and spreads in different ways. Species Cystic echinocccosis Cystic echinocccosis (CE), also known as hydatid disease, is caused by infection with the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus , a ~ – 7 millimeter long tapeworm found in dogs (definitive host) and sheep, cattle, goats, and pigs (intermediate hosts). Although most infections in humans are asymptomatic, CE causes harmful, slowly enlarging cysts in the liver, lungs, and other organs that often grow unnoticed and neglected for years. Alveolar echinococcosis Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) disease is caused by infection with the larval stage of Echinococcus multilocularis , a ~1 – 4 millimeter long tapeworm found in foxes, coyotes, and dogs (definitive hosts). Small rodents are intermediate hosts for E. multilocularis. Although cases of AE in animals in endemic areas are relatively common, human cases are rare. AE poses a much greater health threat to people than CE, causing parasitic tumors that can form in the liver, lungs, brain, and other organs. If left untreated, AE can be fatal.

More research is needed to uncover the causes for, and solutions to, violence against older adults. What is older person abuse? Older person abuse is an intentional act or failure to act that causes or creates a risk of harm to an older adult. An older adult is someone aged 60 or older. The abuse occurs at the hands of a caregiver or other trusted person. Common types of abuse include: Physical abuse is illness, injury, functional impairment, or death resulting from the intentional use of physical force. Examples include hitting, kicking, or pushing. Sexual abuse is forced or unwanted sexual interaction. Examples include unwanted sexual contact or penetration or non-contact acts such as sexual harassment. Emotional or psychological abuse refers to verbal or nonverbal behaviors that inflict anguish, fear, or distress. Examples include humiliation, threats, or harassment. Neglect is the failure to meet an older adult's basic needs. These needs include food, water, shelter, clothing, hygiene, and essential medical care. Financial abuse is the illegal, unauthorized, or improper use of money, benefits, property, or assets for the benefit of someone other than the older adult. For more information about elder abuse definitions please see Elder Abuse Surveillance: Uniform Definitions and Recommended Core Data Elements . Quick facts and stats The older adult population is growing faster in the U.S. than are younger populations. The data underestimate the problem because the number of nonfatal injuries is limited to older adults who are treated in emergency departments. The information doesn’t include those treated by other providers or those that do not need or do not seek treatment. Additionally, many cases are not reported because the older adult is afraid or unable to tell police, friends, or family about the violence. Abuse, including neglect and exploitation, is experienced by about 1 in 10 older adults who live at home. 1 From 2002 to 2016, more than 643,000 older adults were treated in the emergency department for nonfatal assaults and over 19,000\",\n",
       " 'unable to tell police, friends, or family about the violence. Abuse, including neglect and exploitation, is experienced by about 1 in 10 older adults who live at home. 1 From 2002 to 2016, more than 643,000 older adults were treated in the emergency department for nonfatal assaults and over 19,000 homicides occurred. 2 Compared with women, men had higher rates of both nonfatal assaults and homicides. 2 3 The rate for nonfatal assaults increased more than 75% among men (2002–2016) and more than 35% among women (2007–2016). The estimated homicide rate for men increased 7% from 2010 to 2016. 2 Compared to non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Black or African American persons, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaskan Natives, and Hispanic or Latino persons have higher homicide rates (2002–2016). 2 Overall and firearm-specific older adult homicide rates increased between 2014 and 2017. Of the 6,188 victims, 62% were male. The perpetrator was an intimate partner in 39% of firearm homicides and 12% of non-firearm homicides. Common contexts of firearm homicides were familial or intimate partner problems, robbery or burglary, argument, and illness-related (e.g. the homicide was perpetrated to end the suffering of an ill victim, both victim and perpetrator had an illness, or the perpetrator had a mental illness). 3 The economic cost of violent injuries against older adults is also substantial. A recent CDC study found that assault injuries to older adults in the United States cost almost $33 billion in 2022. This reflects a rise in both homicides and nonfatal assaults treated in emergency departments among older adults. Specifically, the rate of nonfatal assaults increased by 31%, while the rate of homicides rose by 26% between 2015 and 2022. 4 Outcomes Abuse can have several physical and emotional effects on an older adult. Victims are fearful and anxious. They may have problems with trust and be wary of others. 5 Many victims suffer physical injuries. Some are minor, like cuts, scratches, bruises, and welts. Others are more serious and can cause lasting disabilities. These include head injuries, broken bones, constant physical pain, and soreness. Physical injuries can also lead to premature death and make existing health problems worse. 3 5 6 7 8 Prevention Violence against older adults can be prevented. Certain factors may increase or decrease the risk of perpetrating or experiencing abuse. Preventing violence requires understanding and addressing the factors that put people at risk for or protect them violence. We can all help prevent violence against older adults: 9 Listen to older adults to understand their challenges and provide support. Educate yourself and others about how to recognize and report abuse. Learn how the signs of abuse differ from the normal aging process. Check-in on older adults who may have few friends and family members. Encourage or assist persons (caregivers or older adults) who have problems with drugs or alcohol in getting help. It is also possible to provide over-burdened caregivers with support. This can include help from friends, family, or local relief care groups, adult day care programs, or',\n",

ELR automates the reporting process by translating information into an electronic message that can be automatically sent and processed. ELR is important because it provides an essential tool in the response to outbreaks. What is ELR? Electronic Laboratory Reporting (ELR) for public health is the transmission of digital laboratory reports, often from laboratories to state and local public health departments, healthcare systems, and CDC. ELR is the transmission of digital laboratory reports between public health agencies. How Does ELR Work? The Process When laboratory tests confirm infection with a reportable condition, such as measles, HIV, or rabies, information about the patient, specimen(s) collected, test(s), and result(s) are entered and stored securely in a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). LIMS is a software-based system that supports key laboratory functions like workflow, specimen and result tracking, and electronic data exchange with other parts of the healthcare and public health system. Information may be manually entered into the LIMS by laboratory personnel, or, in some cases, laboratory instruments may directly connect with the LIMS to automatically transfer the results into the system. The information in the LIMS is used to create standardized electronic messages (such as HL7 v2.5.1 or other ELR formats) that can be processed and understood by other electronic systems. The tests and results may also be translated to standardized codes, such as Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) . After these electronic messages are created, they are sent from the laboratory to public health partners, like the state health department or CDC, through electronic data systems. The public health agency receives the ELR messages and processes them into electronic systems that store information on reportable conditions. The ELR data can be linked with existing case reports or may be used to initiate a new report, enhancing data sharing between epidemiology and laboratory programs. Depending on the condition, the state or local health department may reach out to the patient or healthcare system to perform a case interview, initiate contact tracing, release medical\",\n",
       " 'with existing case reports or may be used to initiate a new report, enhancing data sharing between epidemiology and laboratory programs. Depending on the condition, the state or local health department may reach out to the patient or healthcare system to perform a case interview, initiate contact tracing, release medical countermeasures from the Strategic National Stockpile, or take other public health action. Why is ELR Important? ELR and Outbreak Preparedness ELR provides an essential tool in the response to outbreaks. Outbreaks can be identified more quickly and managed more effectively with quickly delivered, high-quality ELR data. This allows health departments to leverage health information systems to inform response activities. ELR provides an essential tool in disease outbreak response. ELR Improves Laboratory Report Quality Receiving timely, accurate, complete, and consistent laboratory report data can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of public health responses to outbreaks and cases of state reportable conditions. Using standardized formats promotes interoperability and improves exchange, integration, sharing and retrieval of data. Data improvements include: Faster electronic transmission Increased accuracy by reduction of manual data entry errors More complete reports Improved consistency across various data sources ELR Foundations Strengthen COVID-19 Laboratory Reporting As early as 2005, CDC, in partnership with the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) , began paving the way for what is now the COVID-19 Electronic Laboratory Reporting (CELR) program. In 2009, APHL created a secure, cloud-based platform to help state health departments, state laboratories, regional commercial laboratories, and federal agencies report their data. State health departments have increasingly used this platform, supported by ongoing financial and technical support from CDC, to increase the reportable disease results shared with CDC. The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated timely access and dissemination of de-identified electronic healthcare data to guide the domestic response. Previous investments CDC made into reporting systems infrastructure allowed the CELR program to quickly enable detailed data reporting from public health departments to CDC for approximately 90 percent of the COVID-19 testing volume conducted nationwide. This robust dataset informs public health decision-making to help reduce disease in communities.

If people are infected, they can become seriously ill or die. People who are very young or have weakened immune systems are at highest risk. Elizabethkingia infection is often difficult to treat. Overview Elizabethkingia is a family of bacteria found worldwide in the environment (soil, river water, and water sources like plumbing and drains). Despite how common the bacteria are, they usually don't make people sick. In the United States, about 250-500 infections are reported per year. Most infections occur in small outbreaks in health care facilities in people who have pre-existing health conditions. Elizabethkingia is generally considered a hospital-acquired infection, often caused by the bacteria being in the water of the facility or contaminated medical equipment. The illness can kill between one-third and one-half of patients who get it. This is likely due to two factors: Elizabethkingia infection can be severe. Most people with Elizabethkingia are already medically fragile before they get the infection. Signs and symptoms Elizabethkingia infection signs and symptoms vary. Patients often present with blood infections without a clear source. Meningitis (swelling of the brain and nervous system) is also common and is linked to high numbers of illnesses and deaths in children who get sick with the disease. It can also cause: Pneumonia and/or bronchitis (lung or airway infections) Swelling of the heart (endocarditis) Skin and soft tissue infection Urinary tract infections Bone infections Bloodstream infections Infections at surgery sites Who's affected Healthy people are rarely affected by Elizabethkingia . Those at highest risk for infections are: Babies born before 37 weeks gestation People with weakened immune systems People in critical care units in healthcare facilities. Treatment Elizabethkingia infections are treated with antibiotics; however, the bacteria are naturally resistant to many commonly used antibiotics. Clinicians should order susceptibility testing to determine which antibiotics may be most effective.

Children have unique needs during and after disasters. Children are different Children's bodies are different from adults' bodies They are more likely to get sick or severely injured. They breathe in more air per pound of body weight than adults. They have thinner skin, and more of it per pound of body weight (higher surface-to-mass ratio). They have less fluid in their bodies, so fluid loss (e.g. dehydration, blood loss) can have a bigger effect on children. They are more likely to lose too much body heat. They spend more time outside and on the ground. They put their hands in their mouths more often than adults. Children in an emergency Children need help from adults in an emergency Children don't fully understand how to keep themselves safe. Older children and adolescents may take their cues from others. Young children may cry, scream, or become paralyzed with fear. They may not be able to explain what hurts or bothers them. They are more likely to get the care they need when they have parents or other caregivers around. Adults are required by law to make medical decisions for a child. Adults will sometimes have to make decisions with limited information on the ways some illnesses and medicines affect children. Children's mental health Mental stress from a disaster can be harder on children They feel less of a sense of control. They understand less about the situation. They have fewer experiences bouncing back from hard situations. Resources Disasters can strike without any warning. Family members may not all be in the same place. It's important to make a plan so everyone will know what to do. Family Emergency Planning Disaster Master\",\n",

ERHMS includes recommendations for all phases of a response, including pre-deployment, deployment, and post-deployment. Anyone involved in deploying and protecting emergency response and recovery workers can use the framework. Why it's important There are significant gaps and deficiencies in health monitoring and surveillance of emergency response and recovery workers. Examples of these workers include: Police Firefighters Emergency medical personnel Cleanup, repair, restoration, and recovery workers Volunteers Emergency response and recovery workers must be protected from hazardous conditions when responding to disasters and other emergencies. A plan for health monitoring and surveillance is essential to their health and safety. Recognizing this, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) worked with partners to develop the ERHMS framework. Partners include the U.S. National Response Team and several federal agencies, state health departments, labor unions, and volunteer emergency responder groups.

It is critical to protect emergency response and recovery workers' safety and health throughout an emergency. Response leaders can use these recommendations to help prevent illnesses, injuries, and fatalities during an emergency. Overview Preparedness and response activities should address workers' safety and health during all emergency stages, including before, during, and after an event. This helps to ensure that only qualified, trained, and properly equipped personnel are deployed. Recommendations Safety managers, incident command leaders, employers, and other disaster site leaders Information on potential hazards present or expected at a disaster scene helps to establish necessary safety measures. Safety measures are critical to prevent hazards and reduce potential harmful incidents that can occur at the worksite. Examples of safety measures are described below: Establish a system to manage personnel during an emergency Provide training to face a particular hazard Define the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) Install guidelines and mechanisms to be used in case of an emergency The Emergency Responder Health Monitoring and Surveillance (ERHMS) framework provides recommendations for protecting emergency response and recovery workers.

Sanitation and hygiene become especially important during an emergency, such as a natural disaster, when finding clean, safe water could be difficult. Learn about important cleanliness tips to keep yourself and loved ones healthy during an emergency. Wash your hands to prevent the spread of germs Keep hands clean to help prevent the spread of germs. Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially during key times when you are most likely to spread germs. Follow CDC\\'s five easy steps to make sure you are washing your hands the right way. Wash your hands with soap and water that has been boiled or disinfected if local authorities or your doctor recommend extra caution. During a boil water advisory or \"do not drink water\" advisory , it may be safe to wash hands with tap water. If clean tap water is not available, create a temporary handwashing station by using a large water jug. If you do not have soap and water, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.

However, sanitizers do not eliminate all types of germs and might not remove harmful chemicals. Hand sanitizers are not as effective when hands are visibly dirty or greasy. Follow local guidance on water that is safe for bathing If you are using municipal water , listen to your local health and drinking water authorities for guidance on whether you can bathe or shower after a water-related emergency. Sometimes water that is not safe to drink can be used for bathing, but be careful not to swallow any water or get it in your eyes. Do not bathe : In water that may be contaminated with sewage or toxic chemicals. In rivers, streams, or lakes that are contaminated by flood water, human sewage, or animal waste. If you have a drinking water well, listen to your local health authorities for advice on using well water for showering and bathing. If extensive flooding has occurred or you suspect your well may be contaminated, contact your local, state, or tribal health department for specific advice on well testing and disinfection. Use only clean water to brush your teeth Use only clean water to brush your teeth after a water-related emergency. Listen to local authorities to find out if tap water is safe to use. Find information about preparing a home water supply and making your water safe for brushing your teeth. Visit CDC's Oral Health website for information on caring for your teeth. Keep wounds clean and covered Keeping wounds clean and covered is crucial during an emergency. Open wounds and rashes that have been exposed to contaminated water can become infected. Naturally occurring bacteria such as Vibrio that live in certain coastal waters can also cause a skin infection when an open wound is exposed to salt water or brackish water. Brackish water is a mix of salt and fresh water often found where rivers meet the sea. To protect yourself and your family : Avoid contact with flood waters, salt water, or brackish water if you have an open wound (including cuts and scrapes). Keep open wounds as clean as possible by washing well with soap and clean water. Cover clean, open wounds with a waterproof bandage to reduce your chance of infection. Seek immediate medical care if a wound develops redness, swelling, or oozing. Follow guidelines for safe diapering It's always important to change diapers in a safe, germ-free way, but an emergency can make this difficult. Even a microscopic amount of poop can contain millions of germs. CDC has guidelines and checklists to help parents, childcare providers, emergency responders, and others learn how to practice safe and germ-free diaper changing in emergency situations.

EIP sites produce timely, actionable surveillance and evaluation data to inform policy and public health practice. Overview The Emerging Infections Program (EIP) is a network of 12 US sites working to translate infectious disease research into informed policy and public health practice. Each network site is a collaboration between state health departments, academic institutions, and other key public health partners. EIP sites collect extensive data on disease characteristics and risk factors, including variables not collected through standardized reporting, such as underlying medical conditions, clinical course, outcomes, and vaccination status. EIP sites also investigate causes of infectious disease outbreaks, evaluate effectiveness of interventions, and promote prevention. The EIP network can be leveraged in emergencies to rapidly scale up surveillance of emerging infectious diseases and inform quick decision making. During the COVID-19 pandemic, EIP sites worked together to collect extensive data on hospitalized patients, including those first affected . This work described disease trends among adults and children , highlighted differences in hospitalization rates of vaccinated and unvaccinated people , and informed recommendations on strategies to prevent infection. EIP sites rely on robust and integrated data reporting and sharing systems. CDC aims to strengthen these systems through targeted investments in data modernization. These efforts will improve sites' ability to collect, manage, and share public health data. Why it matters For almost 30 years, the EIP network has produced and shared timely, actionable surveillance and research on emerging infectious diseases. For example, EIP work has been instrumental in: providing assessments for disease severity and national disease burden estimates for respiratory viral diseases, including COVID-19, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), evaluating and honing strategies for preventing severe disease in newborns caused by Group B Streptococcus , determining the burden of foodborne illnesses in the United States and monitoring trends in these pathogens over time, providing estimates of SARS-CoV-2- and influenza-associated hospitalizations to inform public health policy, characterizing hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 and influenza cases to investigate vaccine impact, and defining the national burden of healthcare-associated infections in hospitals and identifying priorities for surveillance and prevention.

C. Gray et al. View Abstract Cite This Article In 2009 and again in 2019, public health warnings were confirmed by the emergence, rapid widespread transmission, and lethality of novel influenza and coronaviruses. The world continues to suffer disease from these respiratory viruses. Two newly recognized emergent respiratory viruses, influenza D and canine coronavirus HuPn-2018, have been shown to have considerable potential for causing future human epidemics, but diagnostics and surveillance for the viruses are lacking. We reviewed data regarding influenza D virus and coronavirus canine coronavirus HuPn-2018. Those data strongly indicate that these viruses are major newly recognized threats. However, little is being done to respond to or prevent disease associated with these viruses, warranting the question of whether we will learn from previous pandemics.

View Abstract Cite This Article Pulmonary histoplasmosis has traditionally been considered geographically restricted to disease-endemic regions. Taiwan, historically nonendemic, has recently witnessed rising infections. We conducted a retrospective study by reviewing adult patients in Taiwan who had pathologically confirmed pulmonary histoplasmosis during June 1997–December 2024. We analyzed 14 cases with lung involvement. Eight case-patients were male and 6 female; mean age was 56.6 years. Of note, 11 case-patients (78.6%) had no history of travel to histoplasmosis-endemic regions; 10 (71.4%) were immunocompetent. Left upper lobe involvement was most common (n = 4 [28.6%]), with nodular lesions predominating (n = 12 [85.7%]). Most (11 [78.6%]) patients received antifungal therapy, mostly with voriconazole. Outcomes were favorable; 1 (7.1%) patient died. Two additional case-patients',\n",

Bellafiore et al. View Abstract Cite This Article Reports of ocular manifestations of Lyme disease (LD) are uncommon, and signs and symptoms may be overlooked by physicians. We conducted a retrospective case series of ocular LD reported during 1988–2025. Among 27 published reports in PubMed, we noted that, in 38 cases, the most common ocular manifestation was uveitis, representing 45% of cases, followed by optic neuritis and cranial nerve palsies (including trochlear and abducens). Not all cases met Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveillance guidelines for LD, given that some case reports were published before the current guidelines. Cases that provided microbiologic proof were 2 anterior uveitis cases, 1 case of anterior uveitis with abducens’s nerve palsy, 1 case of intermediate uveitis, and 1 case of intranuclear ophthalmoplegia. Ocular LD can have a broad variety of manifestations; therefore, physicians should be aware of those manifestations and obtain microbiologic proof for a more definitive diagnosis and epidemiologic value when possible.

Coxiella burnetii expresses a tropism for the placenta; resulting infection can potentially lead to spontaneous abortion and fetal demise. Although evidence around preventing transmission and infection in the peripartum and postpartum period is lacking, reports of healthy babies born to mothers with acute or chronic Q fever in pregnancy are increasing. Historically, many clinicians have recommended against breastfeeding in this setting because of a theoretical risk for bacterial transmission through breastmilk. We discuss 2 women in Australia who had Q fever in pregnancy, focusing on the peripartum period and infant management. Breastfeeding was encouraged in both cases. Both infants were born healthy and at term and have demonstrated no serologic or clinical evidence of Q fever infection in the first year of life. EID Silcock R, Horvath R, Chew S, Nourse C.

Case Series of Bacteremia Associated with Probiotic Use in Children after Cardiac Surgery, China [PDF - 424 KB - 6 pages] X. Wang et al. View Abstract Cite This Article We examined probiotic-associated bacteremia in a cohort of postoperative pediatric cardiac surgery patients in China. Among 16,436 children who underwent cardiac surgery during 2019–2024, a total of 5,034 received probiotics; 6 developed bacteremia with probiotic strains ( Bacillus subtilis , Bacillus licheniformis , Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus ). Three cases occurred in children who had not directly received probiotics, suggesting potential cross-contamination or catheter-related transmission. All 6 patients had complex congenital heart disease and central venous catheters; 5 underwent palliative surgery. Fever, elevated C-reactive protein and leukocytes, and use of respiratory support were common. Antibiotic therapy achieved blood-culture clearance in all; 1 death occurred because of underlying cardiac disease, not infection. Our findings conclude probiotic-associated bacteremia is rare and usually resolves with antibiotics; outcomes correlate more with cardiac complexity than bacteremia itself. Maintaining perioperative probiotic use and enhancing infection-control measures, specifically regarding central line care, are recommended to minimize the risk for probiotic-associated bacteremia in pediatric cardiosurgical patients.

Research Medscape CME Activity Group A Streptococcus Meningitis, United States, 1997–2022 [PDF - 1.23 MB - 11 pages] P. A. Hawkins et al. View Abstract Cite This Article Group A Streptococcus (GAS) causes a variety of diseases in humans but is not widely appreciated as a cause of meningitis. During 1997–2022, ten sites participating in the Active Bacterial Core Surveillance network in the United States identified GAS meningitis cases. We calculated annual incidence and case-fatality rates (CFRs) for 320 of those cases and determined antimicrobial resistance by whole-genome sequencing. Annual incidence of GAS meningitis ranged from 0.02 to 0.07 cases/100,000 persons. Children <1 year of age had the highest average annual incidence, 0.23 cases/100,000 children. GAS meningitis had a higher CFR (19.4%) than meningitis caused by group B Streptococcus , Streptococcus pneumoniae , Neisseria meningitidis , or Haemophilus influenzae . Clindamycin resistance among GAS meningitis isolates increased from 3.2% during 1997–2002 to 17.7% during 2018–2022. Clinicians should be aware that meningitis is an uncommon but severe manifestation of invasive GAS and has a higher CFR than more established meningitis etiologies.

Reduced Emergency Department Visits and Hospitalizations in Infants after Universal Respiratory Syncytial Virus Immunization, Italy, 2024–25 [PDF - 2.89 MB - 10 pages] S. Villa et al. View Abstract Cite This Article During the 2024–25 winter season, a universal immunization campaign with nirsevimab was implemented in a region of Italy to prevent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection among infants <12 months of age. We assessed its effects using regional syndromic surveillance data on emergency department visits (EDVs) and hospitalizations for lower respiratory tract infections and RSV infections. We estimated expected burden using an interrupted time series analysis, based on historical trends, and observed values with predictions. Children 1–5 years of age, not eligible for immunization, served as a comparison group. Among infants, EDVs for acute lower respiratory tract infections decreased by 42.7% and hospitalizations decreased by 46.5%, whereas EDVs for RSV infection decreased by 49.3% and hospitalizations decreased by 55.0%. No reductions were observed in children 1–5 years of age, confirming ongoing RSV circulation. Our findings support the effectiveness of universal nirsevimab immunization in reducing severe RSV-related outcomes among infants. EID Villa S, Scarioni S,',\n",

Genomic Insights into Marburg Virus Strains from 2023 and 2025 Outbreaks in Kagera, Tanzania [PDF - 2.36 MB - 8 pages] L. A. Mapunda et al. View Abstract Cite This Article Marburg virus (MARV) is the primary cause of Marburg virus disease (MVD), a severe hemorrhagic fever with a high case-fatality rate. The first reported MVD outbreak in Tanzania occurred in 2023, followed by a second outbreak in 2025, both within the Kagera region. During those MVD outbreaks, 174 suspected cases were identified; of those, 10 were laboratory confirmed. After complete genome assembly and bioinformatic analyses, we found the MARV strains of the 2023 and 2025 outbreaks to be closely related and clustered with MARV strains that caused outbreaks in Rwanda (2024) and Uganda (2014). The sequences from both MVD outbreaks in Tanzania showed >99.71% nucleotide identity, suggesting a possible single spillover event followed by limited human-to-human virus transmission. Further ecologic studies are essential to identify potential spillover events, but our findings indicate that closely related MARV strains circulate in Kagera, Tanzania, posing a risk for future outbreak recurrence.

View Abstract Cite This Article The emergence of a high-risk New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase 14–producing Klebsiella pneumoniae sequence type 147 clone is of public health concern because of its rapid international spread. We report cross-border emergence and rapid dissemination of that clone in the Canary Islands, Spain, during 2023–2025. We analyzed 30 isolates recovered during 2023 in detail by reviewing clinical and epidemiologic data, conducting whole-genome sequencing to assess clonal relatedness and analyze resistomes, and performing antimicrobial susceptibility testing of novel therapeutic options through reference broth microdilution. The isolates formed a well-defined cluster, with minimal genomic distance and identical resistomes, confirming the local outbreak. Those clones were also closely related to other international New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase 14–producing K. pneumoniae sequence type 147 isolates, supporting the ongoing cross-border expansion of that clone. Aztreonam/avibactam was the most active therapeutic option (MICs < 0.125 mg/L). Our findings highlight the need for close monitoring to prevent further dissemination of this clone.

Effect of Chloramine Disinfection of Community Water System on Legionnaires’ Disease Outbreak, Minnesota, USA, 2024 [PDF - 858 KB - 8 pages] M. E. Bledsoe et al. View Abstract Cite This Article The Minnesota Department of Health identified an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease in a city in northern Minnesota, USA, in April 2023 that continued until chloramine disinfection of the community water system was implemented. Before chloramine disinfection was implemented, Legionella pneumophila was detected in 1 of 16 samples from the drinking water distribution system and in 5 of 10 premise plumbing samples using both cultivation-dependent (Legiolert) and cultivation-independent (digital PCR) assays in this independent investigation. Approximately 11 weeks after disinfection was implemented, all distribution system samples tested negative; however, 1 of 6 Legiolert-tested and 3 of 6 digital PCR–tested premise plumbing samples were positive. After 24 weeks of disinfection, all samples collected from the distribution system and premise plumbing tested negative. Our results show that a community water system supplied by groundwater supported substantial growth of L. pneumophila in premise plumbing and that chloramine disinfection halted the outbreak.

Bacteria in Human Respiratory Specimens, Hong Kong, China, 2024 [PDF - 1.71 MB - 11 pages] K. Chiu et al. View Abstract Cite This Article In patients with acute respiratory infections (ARIs), routine diagnostic tests often fail to identify the microbial cause; thus, many ARIs have undetermined etiology. We investigated potential involvement of thermotolerant bacteria in ARIs among patients in Hong Kong, China, by incubating blood agar inoculated with respiratory specimens at 50°C for 5 days. Among 7,257 specimens analyzed, 58 specimens from 57 patients grew thermotolerant bacteria not identified by other methods. We identified Tepidimonas spp. in 42 isolates, 3 of which appear to be a novel Tepidimonas species (tentatively Tepidimonas hongkongensis sp. nov). Genomic analysis revealed various virulence, resistance, and stress-related genomes in the 3 isolates. Tepidimonas spp. bacteria were predominantly isolated from patients with chronic lung disease and malignancies. We also detected T. hongkongensis in hospital water samples but at a lower percentage than in respiratory specimens, suggesting colonization potential. Clinical implications of T. hongkongensis remain unknown; continued surveillance could determine its role in ARIs. EID Chiu K, Wong S, Chiu E, Man Ng R, Chen J, Fong J, et al.

We identified 12 species; T. asahii was the most common species recovered, and the new species T. austroamericanum was next. Comparison of clinical data highlighted species and genotypic differences, such as a much higher proportion of children infected by T. asahii and major differences in antimicrobial drug susceptibility.

Enhanced Isolation and Detection of COVID-19 in Hospitalized Patients Undergoing Antiviral Therapy [PDF - 2.96 MB - 11 pages] R. Perera et al. View Abstract Cite This Article We evaluated the efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 detection from patient respiratory specimens by comparing 3 cell lines: Vero E6, Vero E6 expressing transmembrane protease serine 2 (Vero E6 T2), and Vero E6 expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 (Vero E6 A2T2). We compared a range of sample types, clinical conditions, and real-time reverse transcription PCR cycle threshold values. Vero E6 A2T2 exhibited enhanced sensitivity by supporting efficient virus entry and replication with faster cytopathic effect. Vero E6 culture isolated infectious virus only up to 3 days after PCR confirmation but with Vero E6 A2T2 cells, culture occurred up to 7 days after confirmation. Whole-genome sequencing showed no evidence of adaptive mutations when Vero E6 A2T2 was used for viral culture, supporting use for downstream analyses. Optimized infectious virus detection systems are needed for research and clinical settings, particularly for high-risk, immunocompromised populations that produce virus longer and contribute to variant emergence.

Online Reports Integrating Prevention and Response at the Crossroads of Henipavirus Preparedness, Hendra@30 Conference, 2024 [PDF - 308 KB - 7 pages] K. Halpin et al. View Abstract Cite This Article Diseases caused by henipaviruses, exemplified by Hendra virus and Nipah virus, pose a serious risk to public health because of their epidemic potential and high case-fatality rates and the paucity of medical countermeasures to mitigate them. In December 2024, a group of 150 scientists from 16 countries convened in Geelong, Victoria, Australia, to mark the 30th anniversary of the discovery of Hendra virus. The Hendra@30 conference built upon its predecessor conference held in 2019 in Singapore, Nipah@20, by expanding its program across broader disciplines and integrating sessions on human sociology and disease ecology into the main scientific discussions. We describe key highlights from Hendra@30 and reflect on 4 key elements that have advanced henipavirus research and medical countermeasures research and development. We propose that integrating bat ecology into henipavirus research blueprints will enable development of ecologic countermeasures that prevent spillover and will complement existing preparedness and response efforts with evidence-based prevention strategies.

View Abstract Cite This Article Reports of ocular manifestations of Lyme disease (LD) are uncommon, and signs and symptoms may be overlooked by physicians. We conducted a retrospective case series of ocular LD reported during 1988–2025. Among 27 published reports in PubMed, we noted that, in 38 cases, the most common ocular manifestation was uveitis, representing 45% of cases, followed by optic neuritis and cranial nerve palsies (including trochlear and abducens). Not all cases met Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveillance guidelines for LD, given that some case reports were published before the current guidelines. Cases that provided microbiologic proof were 2 anterior uveitis cases, 1 case of anterior uveitis with abducens’s nerve palsy, 1 case of intermediate uveitis, and 1 case of intranuclear ophthalmoplegia. Ocular LD can have a broad variety of manifestations; therefore, physicians should be aware of those manifestations and obtain microbiologic proof for a more definitive diagnosis and epidemiologic value when possible.

View Abstract Cite This Article Group A Streptococcus (GAS) causes a variety of diseases in humans but is not widely appreciated as a cause of meningitis. During 1997–2022, ten sites participating in the Active Bacterial Core Surveillance network in the United States identified GAS meningitis cases. We calculated annual incidence and case-fatality rates (CFRs) for 320 of those cases and determined antimicrobial resistance by whole-genome sequencing. Annual incidence of GAS meningitis ranged from 0.02 to 0.07 cases/100,000 persons. Children <1 year of age had the highest average annual incidence, 0.23 cases/100,000 children. GAS meningitis had a higher CFR (19.4%) than meningitis caused by group B Streptococcus , Streptococcus pneumoniae , Neisseria meningitidis , or Haemophilus influenzae . Clindamycin resistance among GAS meningitis isolates increased from 3.2% during 1997–2002 to 17.7% during 2018–2022. Clinicians should be aware that meningitis is an uncommon but severe manifestation of invasive GAS and has a higher CFR than more established meningitis etiologies.

We analyzed pregnancy outcomes of women who became pregnant during the study. Among 740 women, 97 (13.1%) became pregnant. Of 102 pregnancies (in 97 participants), 30 (29.4%) participants were exposed to study drugs. Fetal loss was reported for 3/13 (23.1%) in the control regimen, 1/9 (11.1%) in the rifapentine/moxifloxacin regimen, and 1/8 (12.5%) in the rifapentine regimen. Among 21 live births in exposed pregnancies (7 in each arm), 1 infant with a congenital anomaly was reported in a participant on the rifapentine regimen. Among women receiving a short rifapentine/moxifloxacin regimen for tuberculosis who became pregnant, we observed no elevated rates of fetal losses or congenital anomalies.

View Abstract Cite This Article Haematospirillum jordaniae was first identified as a human pathogen in 2016. In this article, we describe 4 patients who had H. jordaniae infections identified in 2020 and who had temporally and spatially linked environmental exposures. Three of the 4 patients reported leg injuries while participating in recreational river water activities in south-central Pennsylvania, USA. In 2024, we detected H. jordaniae in river samples collected at locations identified during patient interviews. All patients sought emergency department services for clinical assessment; however, the causative bacterial isolate was not initially identified. H. jordaniae was identified as the bacterial cause months after patient treatment and discharge. Although H. jordaniae infections are considered rare, the true occurrence is unknown. Additional information about the organism’s ecology and environmental seasonality could guide public health messaging and increase awareness among healthcare providers.

View Abstract Cite This Article Candida bloodstream infections, and their increasing antifungal resistance, are a global concern. In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed 2,443 culture-confirmed candidemia cases reported in South Africa during 2012–2017 to assess the effect of previous antifungal exposure on nonsusceptible Candida infection. We classified cases by species resistance profile and patient’s antifungal use within 14 days before infection. We found that 48% of cases were caused by nonsusceptible species, and 20% of patients had prior antifungal exposure, mainly to fluconazole. In patients >90 days of age, prior antifungal use was significantly associated with nonsusceptible Candida bloodstream infection (adjusted OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.43–2.87; p<0.001), with species-specific effects. No such association was found in neonates and young infants, for whom hospital transmission appeared more influential. Our findings underscore the need for targeted antifungal stewardship and enhanced infection prevention to mitigate antifungal resistance in South Africa.

View Abstract Cite This Article The complexity of rickettsial serodiagnostics during acute illness has limited clinical characterization in Africa. We used archived samples from sepsis (n = 259) and acute febrile illness (n = 70) cohorts in Uganda to identify spotted fever and typhus group rickettsiae by using immunofluorescence assay and clinically validated rRNA reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Among 329 participants, 10.0% had rickettsial infections (n = 33; n = 20 identified with immunofluorescence assay and n = 13 by RT-PCR). Serum rRNA RT-PCR was 75.0% (95% CI 42.8–94.5%) sensitive and 91.2% (95% CI 85.8–95.1%) specific. Thrombocytopenia was more common among patients with rickettsial infections than with other nonmalarial infections (adjusted odds ratio 3.7; p = 0.003). No participants were on a tetracycline antimicrobial drug at admission. rRNA RT-PCR is a promising diagnostic strategy for identifying acute rickettsial infections. Doxycycline should be included in empiric antimicrobial drug regimens for nonmalarial febrile illness in this region. EID Blair PW, Alharthi S, Londoño AF, Wailagala A, Manabe YC, Dumler J.

View Abstract Cite This Article Prevalence of emerging fungal infections is increasing, particularly among immunocompromised persons, children, and older persons. We report 108 cases of Scheffersomyces spartinae infection in pediatric patients from Karachi and other cities in Pakistan, of which 107 were identified from blood cultures. Cultures were initially misidentified as Clavispora lusitaniae by a biochemical assay before speciation as S. spartinae by whole-genome sequencing. All isolates were from children < 12 years of age, and >69% were from children <1 month of age. Isolates were genetically distinct across regions of Pakistan; however, genetic diversity was low in isolates from patients in Karachi and nearby Nawabshah and had median differences of just 9 pairwise nucleotide variants. This study demonstrates S. spartinae is a potentially emerging pathogen in neonates and young infants in Pakistan.

       " 'identified against the backdrop of the smallpox eradication campaign. Monkeypox virus (MPXV), the causative agent of mpox, has been maintained in animal reservoirs in the forested regions of West and Central Africa as 2 distinct clades; clade I has historically caused more severe infection in Central Africa than clade II, historically found in West Africa. However, rapid reemergence and spread of both MPXV clades through novel routes of transmission have challenged the known characteristics of mpox. We summarize mpox demographic distribution, clinical severity, and case-fatality rates attributed to genetically distinct MPXV subclades and focus on MPXV clade Ib, the more recently identified subclade. Broad worldwide assistance will be necessary to halt the spread of both MPXV clades within mpox endemic and nonendemic regions to prevent future outbreaks.

View Abstract Cite This Article Talaromycosis is a life-threatening fungal disease that primarily affects immunocompromised persons in Southeast Asia. We conducted a multicenter, case–control study recruiting participants with advanced HIV disease in Vietnam; 205 case-patients with culture-confirmed talaromycosis were matched to 405 control-patients by age, sex, and CD4 count. Occupational exposure to tropical plants (odds ratio [OR] 1.73 [95% CI 1.10–2.73]; p = 0.017) and to farmed animals (OR 2.07 [95% CI 1.20–3.55]; p = 0.009) were independent risk factors for talaromycosis. Talaromycosis risk was higher in participants from highland regions than in persons from lowland regions (p<0.05). Participants from lowland regions who had lived or traveled to highland regions had a higher risk for talaromycosis (OR 3.15 [95% CI 1.49–6.64]; p = 0.003). This study confirms the epidemiologic correlation between talaromycosis and soil exposure and demonstrates an epidemiologic link between talaromycosis and residence in or travel to highland regions of Vietnam.

View Abstract Cite This Article Spiroplasma ixodetis has been reported to cause the rare combination of cataract and uveitis in infants. Through a retrospective analysis of available literature and additional unpublished cases, we identified 28 eyes from 18 infants from 8 countries in Europe with cataracts and intraocular inflammation. The cataracts were bilateral in 55.6%, unilateral in 44.4%, and progressive in 46.4% of patients. Granulomatous anterior uveitis was found in all infants. Presence of S. ixodetis was supported by PCR (positive in 89.3% of eyes tested), transmission electron microscopy (positive in 90% of eyes tested), or culture of aspirated lens material (positive in 87.5% of eyes tested). Treatment with macrolide antimicrobial drugs, corticosteroids, and lensectomy appeared to be effective. Two patients had a recurrence of the uveitis after lens extraction and needed prolonged treatment. To increase awareness of S. ixodetis , we suggest its inclusion with the organisms of the TORCH acronym. EID Van Os L, Cassoux N, Cholidis S, Dureau P, Farassat N, Fierz F, et al.

View Abstract Cite This Article Invasive aspergillosis (IA) caused by Aspergillus flavus remains poorly described. We retrospectively analyzed 54 cases of IA caused by A. flavus reported in France during 2012–2018. Among cases, underlying IA risk factors were malignancy, solid organ transplantation, and diabetes. Most (87%, 47/54) infections were localized, of which 33 were pleuropulmonary and 13 were ear-nose-throat (ENT) infection sites. Malignancy (70% [23/33]) and solid organ transplantation (21% [7/33]) were the main risk factors in localized pulmonary infections, and diabetes mellitus was associated with localized ENT involvement (61.5%, [8/13]). Fungal co-infections were frequent in pulmonary (36%, 12/33) but not ENT IA (0 cases). Antifungal monotherapy was prescribed in 45/50 (90%) cases, mainly voriconazole (67%, 30/45). All-cause 30-day case-fatality rates were 39.2% and 90-day rates were 47.1%, and rates varied according to risk factor, IA site, and fungal co-infections. Clinicians should remain vigilant for A. flavus and consider it in the differential diagnosis for IA.

In this nationwide case–control study in Sweden, 19 of 23 clinical microbiological laboratories identified patients who had aerococcal BSIs during 2012–2016. We compared each of those index patients with 4 controls matched for age, sex, and county of residence. Overall, 588 episodes of aerococcal BSI occurred over 39.6 million person-years, corresponding to an average incidence of 1.48/100,000 person-years (95% CI 1.37–1.60/100,000 person-years). Most infections developed in men >65 years of age. Aerococcal BSI was associated with neurologic (adjusted odds ratio 2.89 [95% CI 2.26–3.70]) and urologic (adjusted odds ratio 2.15 [95% CI 1.72—2.68]) conditions and previous hospitalization or infection treatment. Our findings support the previously observed predilection for aerococcal BSIs developing in elderly men with urinary tract disorders. Awareness of Aerococcus spp. in patients, especially elderly men, will be needed to manage invasive infections. EID Walles J, Inghammar M, Rasmussen M, Sunnerhagen T.

View Abstract Cite This Article Tularemia, a zoonosis caused by Francisella tularensis , is endemic in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany. To determine tularemia epidemiology in this region, we characterized the genetic diversity of F. tularensis in human and animal isolates during 2012–2022 by using whole-genome sequencing, combined with human and veterinary surveillance data analysis. Human case numbers varied; most cases occurred in 2021 (n = 34). Arthropod bites were reported most in cases with information on animal exposure (45%, n = 43). Poisson regression confirmed a significant increase in human cases during the study period (p<0.001). No seasonal pattern was identified, but case numbers were lowest in winter. Human surveillance data often lacked exposure details. Positivity rates in animals were 5%–34%, increasing since 2017. Human isolates often clustered with hare-derived strains, although transmission routes often remain unclear. These findings emphasize the importance of combining genome sequencing with detailed epidemiologic tracing to identify infection sources and improve surveillance data.

We explored results among study participants with diabetes. Among 2,516 randomized participants, 181 (7.2%) had diabetes. Of 166 participants with diabetes in the microbiologically eligible analysis group, 26.3% (15/57) had unfavorable outcomes in the control regimen, 13.8% (8/58) in the rifapentine/moxifloxacin regimen, and 29.4% (15/51) in the rifapentine regimen. The difference in proportion of unfavorable outcomes between the control and rifapentine/moxifloxacin arms in the microbiologically eligible analysis group was –12.5% (95% CI –27.0% to 1.9%); the difference between the control and rifapentine arms was 3.1% (95% CI –13.8% to 20.0%). Safety outcomes were similar in the rifapentine/moxifloxacin regimen and control arms. Among participants with TB and diabetes, the rifapentine/moxifloxacin arm had fewest unfavorable outcomes and was safe. Our findings indicate that the rifapentine/moxifloxacin regimen can be used in persons with TB and diabetes. EID Kurbatova EV, Whitworth WC, Peddareddy L, Phillips P, Scott NA, Bryant KE, et al.

Most people who are infected don't get sick. Symptoms are often mild for those who do get ill and can include diarrhea and stomach pain. Amebiasis is more common in people living in or traveling to tropical areas with poor sanitary conditions. Antibiotics are effective in treating amebiasis. Overview Amebiasis, caused by the parasite Entamoeba histolytica seen in this magnified image, can be effectively treated with antibiotics. Amebiasis is caused by the parasite Entamoeba histolytica , or E. histolytica . Anyone can get amebiasis. It is more common if you live in a tropical area with poor sanitary conditions or travel to one of these areas. If you think you have amebiasis, see your healthcare provider. The disease can be difficult to diagnose. Most people with amebiasis don't get very sick. Everyone with amebiasis should receive medications to treat the infection. Signs and symptoms Only about 10% to 20% of people infected with E. histolytica become ill. Even then, symptoms are often mild. They can include diarrhea, stomach pain, and stomach cramping. Symptoms usually develop within 2 to 4 weeks but can show up later. A severe form of amebiasis called amebic dysentery can cause stomach pain, bloody poop, and fever. Rarely, E. histolytica travels through the blood stream to the liver and forms an abscess (collection of pus). In a small number of instances, the parasite has spread to other parts of the body, including the lungs and brain. Risk factors In the United States, amebiasis is most common in: People who traveled to tropical places with poor sanitary conditions Immigrants from tropical countries with poor sanitary conditions People who live in facilities with poor sanitary conditions People who have anal sex Causes You can get amebiasis if you: Swallow something such as water or food contaminated with E. histolytica Put something in your mouth that has touched the poop of someone infected with E. histolytica Swallow E. histolytica germs picked up from a contaminated surface or your fingers Prevention Washing your hands thoroughly can help prevent you from spreading amebiasis to others.

You can spread amebiasis to others. The risk is low if you get treated with antibiotics and practice good hygiene. This includes thoroughly washing your hands with soap and water after going to the bathroom or changing diapers. You should also wash your hands before handling or preparing food or drinks. If in an area with poor sanitary conditions: Don\\'t eat or drink: Fountain drinks or any drinks with ice cubes Fresh fruit or vegetables you didn\\'t peel yourself Milk, cheese, and dairy products that may not have been pasteurized Food or drinks sold by street vendors It is safe to drink : Bottled water with an unbroken seal Carbonated (bubbly) water from sealed cans or bottles Carbonated drinks like soda from sealed cans or bottles Tap water that has been boiled for at least 1 minute You also can make tap water safe to drink by first filtering it through an \"absolute 1 micron or less\" filter. Then dissolve chlorine, chlorine dioxide, or iodine tablets in the filtered water. Diagnosis Your healthcare provider will ask for a sample of your poop. You may be asked for several samples from different days. This is because E. histolytica is not always found in every sample. Diagnosing amebiasis can be very difficult. Other parasites and cells can look very similar to E. histolytica under a microscope. If you\\'ve been told that you have an E. histolytica infection but you\\'re feeling fine, you might be infected with a different parasite, Entamoeba dispar, or E. dispar. It is about 10 times more common worldwide. E. dispar doesn\\'t make people sick and doesn\\'t need to be treated. Some laboratories, including CDC, have tests that can tell if a person is infected with E. histolytica or E. dispar . Fluid from liver abscesses can also be tested for E. histolytica . Treatment and recovery A healthcare provider can prescribe antibiotics to treat amebiasis. You will take one antibiotic if you\\'re not feeling sick. If you are sick, you\\'ll probably be prescribed a second antibiotic to take after you\\'ve finished the first.

CRE infections can be prevented. Overview Enterobacterales are a group of bacteria (germs) that are a normal part of the human and animal gut but can also cause infections. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) are germs resistant to one or several antibiotics called carbapenems. In the United States in 2020, there were approximately 12,700 infections and more than 1,100 deaths due to CRE. 1 The annual incidence of CRE rose 18% from 2019 to 2023. 2 Types CRE can include germs like Escherichia coli ( E. coli) and Klebsiella pneumoniae ( K. pneumoniae ) if they develop resistance to carbapenems. New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase producing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (NDM-CRE) are a type of CRE bacteria that cause infections, which are extremely hard to treat. NDM-CRE are spreading rapidly in the United States with an increase of 461% between 2019 and 2023. 2 Signs and symptoms Pneumonia Bloodstream infections Urinary tract infections Wound infections Meningitis Who is at risk Patients in healthcare settings are at most risk for CRE, especially those who: Require devices like ventilators (breathing machines), urinary (bladder) catheters, or intravenous (vein) catheters. Are taking long courses of certain antibiotics. Have weakened immune systems. Healthy people usually do not get CRE infections. How it spreads Person-to-person contact from dirty hands, wounds, or stool (poop). Contaminated medical equipment and devices. A few reports described spread between animals and humans and animal-to-animal spread. In some cases, people or animals can carry the germs on or in their body without being infected, known as colonization. Reducing risk Take antibiotics exactly as your healthcare provider recommends. Follow patient safety tips in healthcare settings. Keep your hands clean . Treatment and recovery CRE infections are difficult to treat. They are resistant to most antibiotics, including carbapenems, drugs often used to treat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. Healthcare providers make treatment decisions for CRE infections on a case-by-case basis. If your provider prescribes antibiotics, take them exactly as instructed and finish the full course, even if you feel better. Colonized patients often do not require treatment.

NIOSH conducts research and provides recommendations for workers to support the safe and responsible deployment of this technology. Overview Additive manufacturing technologies are rapidly expanding in use and accessibility. Large numbers of people use this technology daily. Additive manufacturing technologies pose potential hazards to users. NIOSH is performing research to understand and minimize potential health and safety risk to workers. Definitions Additive manufacturing (also called 3-dimensional or 3D printing) is a set of technologies that assemble objects from smaller pieces of material. Examples of these technologies include fused filament fabrication, vat polymerization, or powder bed fusion. Once just used for prototyping, these techniques are becoming less expensive and are used in production. Additive manufacturing techniques affect the automotive, aerospace, electronics, medical, and consumer markets. Where is it used? Laboratories Factories Hospitals Schools Libraries Homes What are the types of hazards? Additive manufacturing hazards vary widely depending on the technology, materials used, and the environment they are used in. Hazards include: Inhalation of materials used in powdered form may occur. Materials may emit volatile organic compounds (VOC's) during 3D printing. Dermal exposure to powdered and liquid hazardous materials. Risk of fire or explosion from flammable or combustible substances. Mechanical or ergonomic injury from machine support and maintenance, loading and handling of build materials, and handling of products. What is NIOSH doing to help? NIOSH is conducting research on safe additive manufacturing to identify knowledge gaps, to develop robust science necessary to advance understanding in the field, and to best apply these developments in order to protect workers. One pillar of this effort is traditional, laboratory-based research to answer key questions and solve major problems for safe additive manufacturing. Laboratory studies have indicated that: Fused filament fabrication desktop printers emit respiratory irritants Filament material and coloration significantly affect volatile organic compound emission rates Printing with nanomaterial containing filaments lead to emission of nanomaterial containing particulate matter. A second pillar is comprehensive exposure assessments performed by the NIOSH Nanotechnology and Advanced Materials Field Studies Team at ten different additive\""

CDC/ATSDR has created a decision-making tool that can be used by health departments for determining the need to further assess an unusual pattern of cancer. The tool contains a set of criteria that can be used to assess the cancer(s) of concern and/or related environmental risk factors. These criteria promote further assessment of unusual patterns of cancer. Reducing your risk of developing cancer In general, cancers have a variety of risk factors related to behavioral, lifestyle, occupational, and environmental risks. For many cancers, you can reduce your risk of developing cancer by adopting a healthy lifestyle that includes avoiding tobacco use, excessive alcohol consumption, and sun exposure; increasing physical activity; maintaining a recommended body weight; and eating a healthy and nutritious diet. Taking advantage of cancer screening also will reduce your risk. For more information about preventing cancer, visit the following websites CDC's Division of Cancer Prevention and Control The National Institutes of Health's National Cancer Institute American Cancer Society What CDC is doing The federal role in responding to unusual patterns of cancer is limited. As needed, state, tribal, local, or territorial health departments may request technical assistance in response to unusual patterns of cancer from CDC/ATSDR. CDC/ATSDR may provide technical recommendations and make referrals to the appropriate state, tribal, local, or territorial health department or cancer registry.

       "   'The risk of cancer increases with the more excess weight a person gains and the longer a person is overweight. How to lower your risk To reduce your risk of obesity-associated cancer, you can follow a healthy eating plan and get regular physical activity . If you are concerned about your weight or your child\\'s weight, talk to your doctor. \"Talk to Someone\" Simulation Talk to Someone: Physical Activity and Nutrition Talk to Someone: Physical Activity and Nutrition gives tips for cancer survivors to improve physical activity and healthy eating. How doctors can help their patients prevent or treat obesity Health care providers can help patients reach a healthy weight in several ways. For example, they can: Measure patients\\' weight, height, and BMI. Explain that keeping a healthy weight can lower a person\\'s cancer risk. Connect patients and families with community services that provide healthy food and ways to be active. Refer patients with a high BMI who want to lose weight to intensive lifestyle programs. These programs help patients change their physical activity and diet to lower their weight. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends such programs for adults and children, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends programs for children. Discuss the use of medications, surgery, and other treatments for excess weight in older children and adults. Number of new cancers associated with obesity CDC\\'s Data Visualizations tool provides data on new obesity-associated cancers in the United States. For example: More than 716,000 obesity-associated cancers occurred in the United States in 2022, including more than 220,000 among men and 495,000 among women. Breast cancer after menopause is the most common obesity-associated cancer among women. Colorectal cancer is the most common obesity-associated cancer among men. More than 90% of new obesity-associated cancers occur in people who are 50 or older. Note: The data for obesity-associated cancers are based only on cancer type and do not estimate the proportion of cancers caused by obesity.

      " cancer, number of cases, and the age, sex, race, address, occupation, and age at diagnosis of the people with cancer. CDC/ATSDR has created a decision-making tool that can be used by health departments for determining the need to further assess an unusual pattern of cancer. The tool contains a set of criteria that can be used to assess the cancer(s) of concern and/or related environmental risk factors. These criteria promote further assessment of unusual patterns of cancer. Reducing your risk of developing cancer In general, cancers have a variety of risk factors related to behavioral, lifestyle, occupational, and environmental risks. For many cancers, you can reduce your risk of developing cancer by adopting a healthy lifestyle that includes avoiding tobacco use, excessive alcohol consumption, and sun exposure; increasing physical activity; maintaining a recommended body weight; and eating a healthy and nutritious diet. Taking advantage of cancer screening also will reduce your risk. For more information about preventing cancer, visit the following websites CDC's Division of Cancer Prevention and Control The National Institutes of Health's National Cancer Institute American Cancer Society What CDC is doing The federal role in responding to unusual patterns of cancer is limited. As needed, state, tribal, local, or territorial health departments may request technical assistance in response to unusual patterns of cancer from CDC/ATSDR. CDC/ATSDR may provide technical recommendations and make referrals to the appropriate state, tribal, local, or territorial health department or cancer registry. ATSDR is directed by congressional mandate to perform specific functions concerning the effect on public health of hazardous substances in the environment. These functions include the following: Public health assessments of waste sites Health consultations concerning specific hazardous substances Health surveillance and registries Response to emergency releases of hazardous substances Applied research in support of public health assessments Information development and dissemination Education and training concerning hazardous substances Contact your state, tribal, local, or territorial health department or state/territory cancer registry for inquiries regarding unusual patterns of cancer being investigated in your community. More information For more information about cancer in the workplace, visit the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health website. The Guidelines for Examining Unusual Patterns of Cancer and Environmental Concerns provide more information on how unusual patterns of cancer are investigated. Questions? For questions about unusual patterns of cancer in your community, reach out to your state, tribal, local, or territorial health department or cancer registry.

      " The risk of cancer increases with the more excess weight a person gains and the longer a person is overweight. How to lower your risk To reduce your risk of obesity-associated cancer, you can follow a healthy eating plan and get regular physical activity . If you are concerned about your weight or your child's weight, talk to your doctor. \"Talk to Someone\" Simulation Talk to Someone: Physical Activity and Nutrition Talk to Someone: Physical Activity and Nutrition gives tips for cancer survivors to improve physical activity and healthy eating. How doctors can help their patients prevent or treat obesity Health care providers can help patients reach a healthy weight in several ways. For example, they can: Measure patients' weight, height, and BMI. Explain that keeping a healthy weight can lower a person's cancer risk. Connect patients and families with community services that provide healthy food and ways to be active. Refer patients with a high BMI who want to lose weight to intensive lifestyle programs. These programs help patients change their physical activity and diet to lower their weight. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends such programs for adults and children, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends programs for children. Discuss the use of medications, surgery, and other treatments for excess weight in older children and adults. Number of new cancers associated with obesity CDC's Data Visualizations tool provides data on new obesity-associated cancers in the United States. For example: More than 716,000 obesity-associated cancers occurred in the United States in 2022, including more than 220,000 among men and 495,000 among women. Breast cancer after menopause is the most common obesity-associated cancer among women. Colorectal cancer is the most common obesity-associated cancer among men. More than 90% of new obesity-associated cancers occur in people who are 50 or older. Note: The data for obesity-associated cancers are based only on cancer type and do not estimate the proportion of cancers caused by obesity.

      " nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (extra fat in the liver that is not caused by alcohol). Having diabetes. Having hemochromatosis, a condition in which the body takes up and stores more iron than it needs. Eating foods that have aflatoxin (a fungus that can grow on foods, such as grains and nuts that have not been stored properly). Reducing risk You can lower your risk of getting liver cancer in the following ways: Keep a healthy weight and get enough physical activity. Get vaccinated against hepatitis B. Get tested for hepatitis C, and get medical care if you have it. Don't smoke, or quit if you do. Avoid drinking too much alcohol. Statistics The Data Visualizations tool makes it easy for anyone to explore and use the latest official federal government cancer data from United States Cancer Statistics. It includes the latest cancer data covering the US population. Comprehensive cancer control projects Many comprehensive cancer control plans include liver cancer prevention. Several National Comprehensive Cancer Control Program (NCCCP) recipients have joined projects related to liver cancer prevention. For example: People who inject drugs are at higher risk of getting hepatitis C and hepatitis B through use of shared equipment. CDC conducted a project to increase awareness of the link between injecting drugs and getting hepatitis and liver cancer. Four NCCCP recipients participated. In 2019, the NCCCP funded a project to reduce liver, cervical, and skin cancer. The Pennsylvania Comprehensive Cancer Control Program developed materials to educate patients and health care providers about hepatitis B and C screening and hepatitis B vaccination.

An estimated 2-8% of all cancers worldwide are caused by exposures to carcinogens (substances known to cause cancer) in the workplace. Cancers that occur due to workplace exposures can be prevented. Overview Cancers that occur due to workplace exposures can be prevented. There are a wide range of exposures that may contribute to a person’s risk of cancer. This includes but is not limited to: Modifiable behaviors, such as tobacco use Environmental exposures, such as ultraviolet light Infectious agents, such as viruses Inherited genetic mutations Workplace exposures Some specific occupations that have been linked to increased cancer risk include: Firefighting Rubber manufacturing Paving Roofing Painting Chimney sweeping Spotlight Firefighting Exposures and Cancer In 2022, an International Agency for Research on Cancer Working Group of experts assembled to re-evaluate occupational exposure as a firefighter as a carcinogen.

How to lower your risk To reduce your risk of obesity-associated cancer, you can follow a healthy eating plan and get regular physical activity . If you are concerned about your weight or your child\\'s weight, talk to your doctor. \"Talk to Someone\" Simulation Talk to Someone: Physical Activity and Nutrition Talk to Someone: Physical Activity and Nutrition gives tips for cancer survivors to improve physical activity and healthy eating. How doctors can help their patients prevent or treat obesity Health care providers can help patients reach a healthy weight in several ways. For example, they can: Measure patients\\' weight, height, and BMI. Explain that keeping a healthy weight can lower a person\\'s cancer risk. Connect patients and families with community services that provide healthy food and ways to be active. Refer patients with a high BMI who want to lose weight to intensive lifestyle programs. These programs help patients change their physical activity and diet to lower their weight. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends such programs for adults and children, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends programs for children. Discuss the use of medications, surgery, and other treatments for excess weight in older children and adults. Number of new cancers associated with obesity CDC\\'s Data Visualizations tool provides data on new obesity-associated cancers in the United States. For example: More than 716,000 obesity-associated cancers occurred in the United States in 2022, including more than 220,000 among men and 495,000 among women. Breast cancer after menopause is the most common obesity-associated cancer among women. Colorectal cancer is the most common obesity-associated cancer among men. More than 90% of new obesity-associated cancers occur in people who are 50 or older. Note: The data for obesity-associated cancers are based only on cancer type and do not estimate the proportion of cancers caused by obesity.
